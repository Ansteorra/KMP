# Requirements Document: Cool New Feature

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the implementation of a cool new feature. The feature aims to enhance user experience by providing additional functionality that aligns with user needs and business goals.

## User Stories
- [ ] **As a** user, **I want** to access the cool new feature easily from the main interface, **so that** I can use it without navigating through multiple menus.

- [ ] **As a** developer, **I want** the cool new feature to have well-documented APIs, **so that** I can integrate it with other systems efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** the user is on the main interface, **when** they click on the cool new feature button, **then** the feature should open within 1 second.
