# Specification Quality Checklist: Event Waiver Tracking System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-07  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

### Content Quality Assessment
- ✅ The specification is written from a business/user perspective without implementation details
- ✅ Focuses on WHAT users need and WHY, avoiding HOW to implement
- ✅ Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders (event stewards, kingdom officers)
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
- ✅ All 40 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous
- ✅ 10 success criteria are measurable with concrete metrics (time, percentage, counts)
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of databases, frameworks, etc.)
- ✅ 5 user stories with comprehensive acceptance scenarios (27 total scenarios)
- ✅ 8 edge cases identified with clear answers
- ✅ Scope is bounded with "Out of Scope" section listing 10 excluded items
- ✅ 6 dependencies and 10 assumptions explicitly documented

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- ✅ Each of the 40 functional requirements maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ User scenarios progress logically from configuration (P1, P2) through operation (P3, P4) to reporting (P5)
- ✅ Each user story is independently testable and delivers standalone value
- ✅ Success criteria provide measurable targets for feature success
- ✅ No technical jargon or implementation details in the specification

## Notes

**Strengths**:
1. Excellent progressive disclosure - user stories build on each other with clear priorities
2. Comprehensive edge case coverage addresses common failure scenarios
3. Clear separation of concerns between entities (Waiver Type, Event Activity, Event, Uploaded Waiver)
4. Retention policy handling is well-specified with "capture at upload" pattern
5. Security and permission requirements integrated throughout (FR-037 through FR-040)

**Ready for Next Phase**: This specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` - all quality gates passed.
