## Next Actions

**Before Task Breakdown**:
1. Address all CRITICAL gaps (CHK items marked with [Gap] that affect core functionality)
2. Resolve all ambiguities (CHK096-CHK100)
3. Quantify vague non-functional requirements (CHK016-CHK027)
4. Complete missing edge case requirements (CHK055-CHK064)
5. Document all dependencies and validate assumptions (CHK088-CHK095)

**Recommended Priority**:
- **CRITICAL** (blocking task breakdown): CHK003, CHK006-CHK008, CHK015, CHK065-CHK070, CHK096-CHK100
- **HIGH** (needed for complete tasks): CHK016-CHK027, CHK045-CHK054, CHK071-CHK077, CHK107-CHK115
- **MEDIUM** (improves task quality): CHK001-CHK002, CHK055-CHK064, CHK078-CHK087, CHK116-CHK122
- **LOW** (nice to have): CHK028-CHK044, CHK101-CHK106

**Estimated Time to Resolve Critical Items**: 4-6 hours of specification refinement work
