# Tasks: Gathering Waiver Tracking System

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-out-waiver`  
**Input**: Design documents from `/workspaces/KMP/specs/001-build-out-waiver/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md

**Progress**: 130/235 tasks complete (55%) - **User Stories 1, 2, and 3 complete with plugin integration and tests!** 🎉

**Tests**: Test tasks are included as per standard KMP practice. All tests should be written first and verified to fail before implementation (TDD approach).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

- PDF waiver uploads with image-to-PDF conversion
- Mobile camera capture
- Waiver storage with retention policies
- Activity locking when waivers are uploaded

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Upload and Manage Gathering Waivers (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Enable gathering stewards to upload signed waiver images with automatic PDF conversion, retention policy capture, and waiver management.

**Independent Test**: Upload waiver images (JPEG, PNG, TIFF) to gatherings, verify conversion to black and white PDF, check retention policies are captured, test mobile camera capture, verify waiver counts and downloads work.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Waiver Types**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2) - Gathering Types/Activities**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - References waiver types from US1 in UI, but can be implemented independently
- **User Story 3 (P3) - Create Gatherings**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US2 (activities) but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4) - Upload Waivers**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Most complex, uses waiver types from US1, gatherings from US3, but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P5) - Search/Reports**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses data from all previous stories but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD approach)
- Entity/Table classes before services
- Services before controllers
- Controllers before templates
- Templates before Stimulus controllers
- Stimulus controllers before asset compilation
- Core implementation before integration testing
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T002-T007)
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within sub-phases:
  - Migrations: T010-T017 (sequential - core before plugin)
  - Entities: T018-T029 (all parallel)
  - Tables: T022-T033 (all parallel)
  - Policies: T034-T039 (all parallel)
  - Services: T040-T043 (all parallel)
  - Plugin Setup: T044-T046 (all parallel)
- Once Foundational phase completes (T048), all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models/services within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T185-T192, T196-T197, T201)

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create WaiverTypesFixture" (T050)
Task: "Create WaiverTypesTableTest" (T051)
Task: "Create WaiverTypeTest" (T052)
Task: "Create WaiverTypesControllerTest" (T053)
Task: "Create RetentionPolicyServiceTest" (T054)

# Launch parallel implementation tasks:
Task: "Create WaiverTypesController" (T055)
Task: "Add authorization checks" (T056)
Task: "Create retention-policy-input-controller.js" (T062)
Task: "Add CSS styling" (T063)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T010-T048) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T050-T070)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready - Kingdom officers can now configure waiver types

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready (T001-T048)
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP - waiver type configuration)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (gathering framework configuration)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (gathering creation with waiver requirements)
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (waiver uploads with PDF conversion - MAJOR VALUE)
6. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (search and reporting - COMPLETE SYSTEM)
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T048)
2. Once Foundational is done (after T048):
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T050-T070) - Waiver Types
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T075-T099) - Gathering Types/Activities
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T100-T122) - Create Gatherings
3. After initial stories complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 4 (T125-T155) - Upload Waivers (most complex)
   - Developer B: User Story 5 (T160-T182) - Search/Reports
4. All developers: Phase 8 Polish (T185-T201)
5. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 201 tasks

**Task Count per User Story**:
- Setup (Phase 1): 7 tasks
- Foundational (Phase 2): 39 tasks (CRITICAL - blocks all user stories)
- User Story 1 (P1): 21 tasks (Waiver Types configuration)
- User Story 2 (P2): 25 tasks (Gathering Types/Activities configuration)
- User Story 3 (P3): 23 tasks (Create Gatherings)
- User Story 4 (P4): 31 tasks (Upload Waivers - most complex)
- User Story 5 (P5): 23 tasks (Search/Reports)
- Polish (Phase 8): 17 tasks + manual testing checklist

**Parallel Opportunities Identified**:
- Setup: 6 parallel tasks (T002-T007)
- Foundational: 26 parallel tasks across entities, tables, policies, services
- User Stories: All 5 stories can start in parallel after Foundational completes
- Within stories: Tests, models, services, and assets often parallelizable
- Polish: 9 parallel tasks (T185-T192, T196-T197, T201)

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- **US1**: Create/edit waiver types, verify retention policy validation and display
- **US2**: Create gathering types/activities, associate waivers, verify required/optional marking
- **US3**: Create gatherings, select activities, verify required waivers auto-determined, test activity locking
- **US4**: Upload images, verify PDF conversion and compression, test mobile camera, verify retention capture
- **US5**: Search gatherings, filter by criteria, generate compliance reports, test expired waiver identification

**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Story 1 only (T001-T070) - enables basic waiver type configuration and retention policy management. This provides immediate value for legal documentation setup and can be deployed independently for validation before proceeding with gathering management.

**Recommended Full Release Scope**: User Stories 1-4 (T001-T155) - provides complete waiver tracking with mobile upload and PDF conversion. User Story 5 (search/reports) can be added in a subsequent release as an enhancement.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Foundational phase (Phase 2) is CRITICAL - no user story work can begin until it completes
- Image-to-PDF conversion (User Story 4) is the most technically complex component - requires thorough testing
- Mobile camera capture testing requires physical iOS and Android devices
- Storage adapter configuration (local vs S3) should be tested in both modes
- Retention policy calculations should be thoroughly tested with various configurations
- Activity locking business rule is critical for data integrity - must be enforced
