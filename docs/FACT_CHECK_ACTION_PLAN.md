# KMP Documentation Fact-Check Action Plan

## Overview

This action plan outlines a systematic approach to fact-check each documentation file in the `docs/` folder against the actual source code to ensure accuracy. Each document will be verified against relevant source files, configuration files, and implementation details.

**Status**: Created on July 19, 2025  
**Total Documents**: 32 files to fact-check

## Fact-Check Methodology

For each document, follow this systematic approach:

### 1. Document Analysis
- Read the document completely
- Identify all technical claims, code examples, and implementation details
- List specific source files that need to be verified
- Note any configuration references or file paths

### 2. Source Code Verification
- **Controllers**: Verify against `src/Controller/` and plugin controllers
- **Models**: Verify against `src/Model/` (Table, Entity classes)
- **Services**: Verify against `src/Services/`
- **Behaviors**: Verify against `src/Model/Behavior/` and `src/KMP/`
- **Configuration**: Verify against `config/` files
- **Plugins**: Verify against `plugins/*/` directories
- **Templates**: Verify against `templates/` and plugin templates
- **JavaScript**: Verify against `assets/js/` and plugin assets
- **Database**: Verify against `config/Migrations/` and `config/schema/`

### 3. Common Verification Points
- **File Paths**: Ensure all referenced paths exist and are correct
- **Class Names**: Verify class names match actual implementation
- **Method Signatures**: Verify method names, parameters, and return types
- **Configuration Options**: Verify config keys and default values
- **Database Tables/Fields**: Verify table and column names
- **Route Definitions**: Verify against `config/routes.php` and plugin routes
- **Code Examples**: Test code examples for syntax and accuracy

### 4. Documentation Update Process
- Document discrepancies found
- Update documentation with correct information
- Add missing information discovered during verification
- Remove outdated or incorrect information
- Ensure consistency across related documents
