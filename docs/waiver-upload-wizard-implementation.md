# Waiver Upload Wizard - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Transformed the single-page waiver upload form into a modern, multi-step wizard experience with client-side state management using Stimulus.js.

## Architecture

### Client-Side State Management
All form data is held in the Stimulus controller until final submission:
- `selectedActivities[]` - Array of activity objects with id, name, waiver_types
- `selectedWaiverType` - Object with id and name
- `uploadedPages[]` - Array of File objects from user selection
- `notes` - String from textarea
- `currentStep` - Integer tracking wizard progress (1-5)

### Wizard Flow

```
Step 1: Select Activities
    ↓ User selects 1+ activities
    ↓ Controller extracts common waiver types
Step 2: Select Waiver Type
    ↓ User selects from filtered waiver types
    ↓ Only types required by ALL selected activities shown
Step 3: Add Pages
    ↓ User adds multiple images with "Add Page" button
    ↓ Preview shows thumbnails with remove option
    ↓ Validates: JPEG/PNG/TIFF, <10MB per file
Step 4: Review & Submit
    ↓ Shows summary of all selections
    ↓ User can add optional notes
    ↓ Submit button appears
Step 5: Success Confirmation
    ↓ Shows success message
    ↓ Redirects to gathering view after 2 seconds
```

  $activitiesData = []; // Activity ID, name, description, waiver_types[]
  $waiverTypesData = []; // Waiver type ID, name, description
  ```
- Replaced entire form section with wizard structure:
  - Removed old `$this->Form->create()` with single-page fields

  - Added progress bar (8px, striped, animated)
  - Added step indicators (4 steps with Bootstrap badges and icons)
  - Included `upload_wizard_steps` element
  
**Data Attributes**:
```html
data-controller="waiver-upload-wizard"
data-waiver-upload-wizard-gathering-id-value="<?= $gathering->id ?>"
data-waiver-upload-wizard-upload-url-value="<?= $this->Url->build(['action' => 'upload']) ?>"
data-waiver-upload-wizard-activities-value="<?= h(json_encode($activitiesData)) ?>"
data-waiver-upload-wizard-waiver-types-value="<?= h(json_encode($waiverTypesData)) ?>"
```

## Data Flow

### Client-Side (Before Submission)
1. User interacts with form → Stimulus controller updates internal state
2. Each step validates before allowing progression
3. Review step shows read-only summary from controller state
4. No server communication until final submit

### Submission Process
```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('gathering_id', gatheringId);
formData.append('waiver_type_id', selectedWaiverType.id);

selectedActivities.forEach(activity => {
    formData.append('activity_ids[]', activity.id);
});

uploadedPages.forEach((page, index) => {
    formData.append('waiver_images[]', page.file, page.file.name);
});

formData.append('notes', notes);

// POST to /waivers/gathering-waivers/upload
```

### Server-Side (Existing Endpoint)
The wizard submits to the existing `GatheringWaiversController::upload()` action:
- Validates gathering exists and user has permission
- Processes `waiver_images[]` file uploads
- Creates GatheringWaiver record
- Associates with selected activities via GatheringWaiverActivities
- Converts images to B&W PDF via document service
- Returns JSON response with success/error

## Validation

### Client-Side Validation

**Step 1 - Activities**:
- At least one activity must be selected
- Error message if user tries to proceed with none selected

**Step 2 - Waiver Type**:
- Must select exactly one waiver type
- Only shows types required by ALL selected activities
- Error message if none selected

**Step 3 - Add Pages**:
- At least one image required
- File type: JPEG, PNG, or TIFF only
- File size: Maximum 10MB per image
- Error alerts for invalid files
- Duplicate prevention (same filename)

**Step 4 - Review**:
- All previous validations must pass
- Notes are optional

### Server-Side Validation
Existing validation in controller remains:
- Gathering must exist
- User must have `canUploadWaiver` permission
- Waiver type must exist
- At least one activity required
- Files must be valid images

## UI/UX Features

### Progress Tracking
- Progress bar fills as steps complete (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Step indicators show: Upcoming (gray), Active (blue), Completed (green)
- Step numbers with icons (Activity, File, Image, Check)

### Visual Feedback
- Activity cards highlight when selected
- Waiver type cards show selected state
- Image thumbnails with page numbers
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Smooth fade-in animations between steps

### Mobile Support
- File input has `capture="environment"` for camera access
- Responsive grid layouts (single column on mobile)
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Vertical step indicators on small screens

### Error Handling
- Inline validation messages
- File type/size error alerts
- Network error handling with user-friendly messages
- Prevents double-submission with loading states

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Tests
- [ ] Step 1: Select single activity, verify step 2 shows filtered types
- [ ] Step 1: Select multiple activities, verify only common types shown
- [ ] Step 2: Select waiver type, verify stored in controller state
- [ ] Step 3: Add single image, verify preview appears
- [ ] Step 3: Add multiple images, verify all previewed with page numbers
- [ ] Step 3: Remove image, verify preview updates
- [ ] Step 3: Validate file type error (try PDF or TXT)
- [ ] Step 3: Validate file size error (try >10MB image)
- [ ] Step 4: Verify all selections shown in review
- [ ] Step 4: Add notes, verify included in submission
- [ ] Submit: Verify FormData constructed correctly
- [ ] Submit: Verify redirect after success
- [ ] Navigation: Previous button works at each step
- [ ] Navigation: Next button validates before progressing
- [ ] Cancel: Returns to gathering view

### Edge Cases
- [ ] No activities in gathering (should show warning)
- [ ] Activity with no waiver types (skip to next step?)
- [ ] Multiple activities with NO common waiver types (show error)
- [ ] Select activity, then deselect all (should show error on next)
- [ ] Upload same file twice (duplicate prevention)
- [ ] Network timeout during submission (error handling)
- [ ] Large file upload progress (progress bar updates?)

### Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Chrome/Edge (Chromium) - Desktop
- [ ] Firefox - Desktop
- [ ] Safari - Desktop
- [ ] Chrome - Android (camera capture)
- [ ] Safari - iOS (camera capture)

### Accessibility
- [ ] Keyboard navigation between steps
- [ ] Screen reader announces step changes
- [ ] Form labels properly associated
- [ ] Error messages announced to screen readers
- [ ] Focus management (trap in modal during upload?)

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 - Mobile SPA
The wizard pattern was designed for reuse in a mobile single-page application:
- Extract controller into shared module
- Add PWA offline support
- Store drafts in IndexedDB
- Background sync for uploads
- Native camera integration via Capacitor

### Phase 3 - Advanced Features
- **Auto-save Drafts**: Save state to localStorage every 30 seconds
- **Upload Progress**: XMLHttpRequest.upload.onprogress for real-time feedback
- **Image Editing**: Crop, rotate, brightness/contrast before upload
- **OCR Integration**: Extract text from images for searchability
- **Batch Upload**: Upload multiple waivers in single session
- **Signature Capture**: Add digital signature step for self-waivers

## Dependencies

### JavaScript
- `@hotwired/stimulus` - Controller framework
- Browser FileReader API - Image previews
- Browser FormData API - Multi-part uploads
- Browser Fetch API - Async form submission

### PHP/CakePHP
- CakePHP 5.x Form Helper - Element rendering
- CakePHP 5.x Html Helper - CSS/URL generation
- Existing GatheringWaiversController::upload() action
- Existing Document service for PDF conversion

### CSS
- Bootstrap 5 - Grid, cards, buttons, progress bar, badges
- Bootstrap Icons - Step icons (bi-activity, bi-file-earmark-text, etc.)
- Custom wizard CSS - Step indicators, transitions, mobile responsive

## Configuration

### File Upload Limits
**Client-Side**:
```javascript
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB
const ALLOWED_TYPES = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/tiff'];
```

**Server-Side** (PHP.ini):
```ini
upload_max_filesize = 25M
post_max_size = 30M
max_file_uploads = 20
```

### Compilation
```bash
cd /workspaces/KMP/app
npm run dev        # Development build with source maps
npm run production # Production build (minified)
npm run watch      # Auto-recompile on file changes
```

### Asset URLs
- JavaScript: `/js/controllers.js` (compiled bundle)
- CSS: `/Waivers/css/waiver-upload-wizard.css` (plugin asset)
- Manifest: `/js/manifest.js` (webpack runtime)
- Vendor: `/js/core.js` (Bootstrap, Stimulus, Turbo)

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **No Draft Saving**: If user closes browser, all progress lost
   - Workaround: Add localStorage save in Phase 2

2. **No Upload Progress**: User doesn't see real-time upload progress
   - Workaround: Shows spinner, but could add percentage with XHR

3. **Large Files**: 10MB limit may be too small for high-res scans
   - Consider: Client-side image compression before upload

4. **Duplicate Detection**: Only checks filename, not content hash
   - Enhancement: Generate SHA-256 hash for true duplicate detection

5. **Waiver Type Filtering**: If no common types, wizard breaks
   - Need: Error message and allow manual selection override

## Support & Maintenance

### Debugging
Enable Stimulus debug mode:
```javascript
// In assets/js/index.js
window.Stimulus = Application.start()
window.Stimulus.debug = true
```

View logs in browser console:
- `[Stimulus]` - Controller lifecycle events
- `[waiver-upload-wizard]` - Custom debug messages (if added)

### Common Issues

**Wizard not loading**:
- Check browser console for JS errors
- Verify `npm run dev` compiled successfully
- Ensure `/js/controllers.js` is loaded in page
- Check `data-controller="waiver-upload-wizard"` attribute present

**Steps not advancing**:
- Check validation logic in controller
- Verify all required targets present in template
- Check for JS errors in browser console

**Files not uploading**:
- Check server PHP error logs
- Verify file size limits (client and server)
- Check network tab for failed POST request
- Verify CSRF token present in headers

**CSS not applied**:
- Verify CSS file in `/app/plugins/Waivers/webroot/css/`
- Check `$this->Html->css()` call in template
- Clear browser cache / hard refresh
- Run `npm run dev` to recompile if using Sass
