**Quick Links to Documentation**:
- [Plugin Architecture & Configuration](5.6.1-activities-plugin-architecture.md) - **START HERE**
- [Workflows & Authorization Lifecycle](5.6-activities-plugin.md) - Business logic and workflows
- [Refactoring Summary](5.6-activities-plugin-documentation-refactoring.md) - What changed

## Quick Start: Where to Find What

### For Understanding the Plugin Architecture
→ Read: [5.6.1-activities-plugin-architecture.md](5.6.1-activities-plugin-architecture.md)

Covers:
- Plugin design and structure
- All core components and entities
- Service registration and dependency injection
- Navigation and UI integration
- Configuration management

### For Understanding Authorization Workflows
→ Read: [5.6-activities-plugin.md](5.6-activities-plugin.md)

Covers:
- Authorization lifecycle and state machine
- Request/approval/renewal/revocation workflows
- Multi-level approval process
- Activity management
- Integration with RBAC

### For Integration in Your Code
→ Read: [5.6.1-activities-plugin-architecture.md § Service Registration](5.6.1-activities-plugin-architecture.md#service-registration)

Shows:
- How to inject the AuthorizationManagerInterface
- Controller integration examples
- Service layer usage patterns

### For Configuration
→ Read: [5.6.1-activities-plugin-architecture.md § Configuration Management](5.6.1-activities-plugin-architecture.md#configuration-management)

Explains:
- Application settings
- Configuration versioning
- Automatic migrations
- Default initialization

## Key Documentation Updates

**Important**: Status constants updated from 5 to 6:
- `APPROVED_STATUS` - Authorization is active and valid
- `PENDING_STATUS` - Authorization awaiting approval
- `DENIED_STATUS` - Authorization request was rejected
- `REVOKED_STATUS` - Previously approved authorization was revoked
- `EXPIRED_STATUS` - Authorization has passed its expiration date
- **`RETRACTED_STATUS`** - Member retracted pending request ← **ADDED**

## Source Code Documentation

The Activities Plugin source file has been refactored for clarity:
- Minimal inline documentation focused on maintenance
- Code docblocks link to comprehensive `/docs` files
- All usage examples moved to documentation
- All integration patterns documented separately

## Common Tasks

### "I need to add an authorization request to my controller"
1. Read: [Service Registration § Usage in Controllers](5.6.1-activities-plugin-architecture.md#usage-in-controllers)
2. Get the service: `AuthorizationManagerInterface $authorizationManager`
3. Call: `$authorizationManager->request($activityId, $memberId)`

### "I need to understand the full authorization lifecycle"
1. Read: [Authorization Lifecycle Workflow](5.6-activities-plugin.md#authorization-lifecycle-workflow)
2. Review: State machine diagram showing all transitions
3. Check: Status constants and their meanings

### "I need to know what authorizations a member has"
1. Read: [Member Participation Tracking](5.6-activities-plugin.md#member-participation-tracking)
2. Review: Authorization entity relationships
3. Check: Available queries and finder methods

### "I need to configure how many approvers are needed"
1. Read: [Activity Entity](5.6.1-activities-plugin-architecture.md#activity-entity)
2. Set: `num_required_authorizors` for new requests
3. Set: `num_required_renewers` for renewals

### "I need to add navigation items for Activities"
1. Read: [Navigation & UI Integration](5.6.1-activities-plugin-architecture.md#navigation--ui-integration)
2. Review: Dynamic navigation provider pattern
