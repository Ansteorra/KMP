# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 About KMP

The Kingdom Management Portal (KMP) is a comprehensive web-based membership management system specifically designed for SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism) Kingdoms. Built on the CakePHP framework, KMP provides a robust and extensible platform that allows SCA Kingdoms to manage their membership data, activities, officers, awards, and various administrative functions.

### Key Features

- **Member Management**: Registration, profile management, and membership tracking
- **Branch Management**: Hierarchical organization of Kingdom branches (Baronies, Shires, etc.)
- **Officer Management**: Officer warrants, reporting, and roster management
- **Award Recommendations**: Processing and tracking of award recommendations
- **Activity Management**: Event registration and participation tracking
- **Role-based Access Control**: Granular permissions system to control access to features

KMP is designed to be modular through its plugin architecture, allowing for customization and extension to meet the specific needs of different SCA Kingdoms.

## 1.2 Project Purpose

The Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA) is an international non-profit volunteer educational organization dedicated to researching and re-creating pre-17th century European history. Each SCA Kingdom requires significant administrative infrastructure to manage its members, events, officers, and awards.

The purpose of the Kingdom Management Portal is to:

1. **Centralize Member Data**: Provide a single source of truth for membership information
2. **Streamline Administrative Processes**: Automate workflows for warrants, awards, and reporting
3. **Enhance Communication**: Facilitate communication between members, officers, and administrators
4. **Ensure Data Security**: Protect sensitive member information through secure authentication and authorization
5. **Support Decision Making**: Generate reports and analytics to support Kingdom leadership
6. **Maintain Historical Records**: Preserve the history of awards, offices, and activities

KMP addresses these needs through a modern web application that is accessible both to technical and non-technical users, ensuring that SCA Kingdoms can focus on their core mission rather than administrative overhead.
