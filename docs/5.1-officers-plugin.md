# 5.1 Officers Plugin

**Last Updated:** July 18, 2025  
**Status:** Complete  
**Plugin:** Officers  

The Officers plugin manages the officer structure, responsibilities, and hierarchy within the kingdom.

## Purpose

This plugin defines the officer positions, their relationships, and their organizational structure. It works closely with the Warrants module to manage officer appointments.

## Data Model

```mermaid

## Officer Assignment Workflow

### Complete Assignment Lifecycle

The Officers plugin implements a comprehensive officer assignment lifecycle that spans from initial appointment through active management to eventual release. This workflow integrates multiple KMP systems including warrant management, role-based access control, temporal validation, and organizational hierarchy management.

#### 1. Assignment Initiation

**Member Selection and Validation**
- Administrative users navigate to the officer assignment interface through the Officers navigation menu
- The assignment controller (`assign-officer-controller.js`) provides real-time member search with autocomplete functionality
- Member validation includes:
  - Active membership status verification
  - Branch context validation for organizational scope
  - Existing assignment conflict checking
  - Eligibility verification based on organizational rules

**Office Discovery and Selection**
- The system presents available offices based on:
  - Department organizational structure
  - Branch context and geographical scope
  - Hierarchical relationships and reporting structures
  - Current assignment status and availability
- Office configuration includes:
  - Warrant requirements and role grants
  - Hierarchical position within departmental structure
  - Deputy relationships and reporting chains
  - Term length and temporal management settings

#### 2. Assignment Processing

**Service-Oriented Architecture**
The `DefaultOfficerManager` service implements the core assignment business logic:

```php
// Assignment workflow through OfficerManagerInterface
$result = $officerManager->assign(
    $officeId,
    $memberId,
    $branchId,
    $startOn,
    $endOn,
    $deputyDescription,
    $approverId,
    $emailAddress
);
```

**Validation and Business Rules**
- Pre-assignment validation includes:
  - Office availability verification
  - Member eligibility checking
  - Hierarchical constraint validation
  - Temporal conflict resolution
- Business rule enforcement:
  - Single assignment per office constraints
  - Deputy relationship validation

  - Historical assignment tracking

**Automatic Status Management**
- Real-time status updates based on temporal boundaries
- Assignment activation on start dates
- Automatic expiration handling
- Grace period management for transitions

#### 4. Role-Based Security Integration

**Permission-Based Assignment Authority**
- Authorization policies control assignment capabilities:
  - `OfficerPolicy::canAssign()` validates assignment authority
