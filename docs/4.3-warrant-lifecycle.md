# 4.3 Warrant Lifecycle - Complete State Machine and Approval Process

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** July 16, 2025  
**Status:** Comprehensive documentation based on source code analysis  

## Overview

The KMP Warrant System provides temporal validation for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions through a sophisticated state machine and multi-level approval process. Warrants serve as time-bounded authorization that determines when role-based permissions are actually active and enforceable in the system.

## 4.1 Warrant Architecture

### Core Components

The warrant system consists of four primary entities that work together to provide temporal validation:

```mermaid
graph LR
    WP[WarrantPeriod<br/>Template for<br/>time boundaries] --> WR[WarrantRoster<br/>Batch approval<br/>container]
    WR --> W[Warrant<br/>Individual<br/>warrant entity]
    W --> MR[MemberRole<br/>Role assignment<br/>being validated]
    WRA[WarrantRoster<br/>Approvals<br/><br/>Multi-level<br/>approval track] --> WR
```

### RBAC Integration Flow

```mermaid

    M[Members] --> MR[MemberRoles]
    MR --> R[Roles]
    R --> P[Permissions]
    MR --> W[Warrants<br/>Temporal Validation]
    W --> AP[Active Permissions]
    
    style W fill:#e1f5fe
    style AP fill:#c8e6c9
```

When `KMP.RequireActiveWarrantForSecurity` is enabled, the PermissionsLoader validates permissions only when:
- Member has the role assignment (MemberRole)
- AND there's an active warrant for that role assignment
- AND the warrant is within its valid time period
- AND the warrant status is 'Current'

## 4.2 Entity Status Definitions

### Warrant Entity Statuses

Based on `ActiveWindowBaseEntity` and `Warrant` entity constants:

| Status | Source | Description | Permission Impact |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Pending** | `Warrant::PENDING_STATUS` | Awaiting approval through warrant roster system | No permissions granted |
| **Current** | `ActiveWindowBaseEntity::CURRENT_STATUS` | Active and providing temporal validation | Permissions granted if within time period |
| **Upcoming** | `ActiveWindowBaseEntity::UPCOMING_STATUS` | Scheduled for future activation | No permissions granted yet |
| **Expired** | `ActiveWindowBaseEntity::EXPIRED_STATUS` | Past expiration date | No permissions granted |
| **Deactivated** | `ActiveWindowBaseEntity::DEACTIVATED_STATUS` | Administratively terminated before expiration | No permissions granted |
| **Cancelled** | `ActiveWindowBaseEntity::CANCELLED_STATUS` | Cancelled during pending state before activation | No permissions granted |
| **Declined** | `Warrant::DECLINED_STATUS` | Rejected during approval process | No permissions granted |
| **Replaced** | `ActiveWindowBaseEntity::REPLACED_STATUS` | Superseded by newer warrant for same entity/member | No permissions granted |
| **Released** | `ActiveWindowBaseEntity::RELEASED_STATUS` | Explicitly released/terminated | No permissions granted |

### Warrant Roster Statuses

Based on `WarrantRoster` entity constants:

| Status | Constant | Description | Workflow State |
|--------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Pending** | `WarrantRoster::STATUS_PENDING` | Awaiting required approvals | Active approval workflow |
| **Approved** | `WarrantRoster::STATUS_APPROVED` | Has received required approvals | Warrants activated |
| **Declined** | `WarrantRoster::STATUS_DECLINED` | Rejected during approval process | Warrants cancelled |

## 4.3 Warrant Lifecycle States

### 1. Request Phase

**Initial State:** None (warrants don't exist yet)

**Process:** WarrantManager creates warrant roster and individual warrants

```php
// From DefaultWarrantManager::request()
$warrantRoster->status = WarrantRoster::STATUS_PENDING;
$warrantRequestEntity->status = Warrant::PENDING_STATUS;
```

**Validation Checks:**
- Member must be warrantable (`$member->warrantable != null`)
- Warrant period must not exceed membership expiration
- Valid warrant period must exist

**Database Transaction:** Ensures atomicity of roster and warrant creation

### 2. Pending Approval Phase

**State:** `Warrant::PENDING_STATUS`

**Characteristics:**
- Warrant exists but provides no permissions
- Part of a WarrantRoster awaiting approvals
- Can be viewed and managed through administrative interface
- Subject to approval workflow requirements

**Approval Requirements:**
- Configurable number of approvals required (from `StaticHelpers::getAppSetting('Warrant.RosterApprovalsRequired', '2')`)
- Each approval recorded in `WarrantRosterApprovals` table
- Approval count tracked in `WarrantRoster.approval_count`

### 3. Approval Transition

**Trigger:** `WarrantManager::approve()` when required approvals met

**Process from DefaultWarrantManager:**
```php
if ($warrantRoster->hasRequiredApprovals()) {
    $warrantRoster->status = WarrantRoster::STATUS_APPROVED;
    foreach ($warrants as $warrant) {
        $warrant->status = Warrant::CURRENT_STATUS;
        $warrant->approved_date = new DateTime();
        
        // Adjust start date if period already began
        if ($warrant->start_on == null || $warrantStart < $now) {
            $warrant->start_on = $now;
        }
        
        // Expire conflicting warrants
        $warrantTable->updateAll([
            'expires_on' => $warrant->start_on,
            'revoked_reason' => 'New Warrant Approved',
            'revoker_id' => $approver_id,
        ], [/* matching criteria */]);
    }
}
```

**Automatic Actions:**
- All pending warrants in roster become `CURRENT_STATUS`
- Start dates adjusted to current time if already past
- Conflicting warrants automatically expired
- Email notifications queued for warrant recipients

### 4. Active Phase

**State:** `ActiveWindowBaseEntity::CURRENT_STATUS`

**Characteristics:**
- Warrant provides temporal validation for RBAC permissions
- Subject to date range validation (`start_on` <= now < `expires_on`)
- Integrated with PermissionsLoader for security enforcement
- Can be administratively revoked or cancelled

**Permission Validation Query Pattern:**
```php
$warrantSubquery = $warrantsTable->find()
    ->select(['Warrants.member_role_id'])
    ->where([
        'Warrants.start_on <' => $now,      // Warrant has started
        'Warrants.expires_on >' => $now,    // Warrant hasn't expired
        'Warrants.status' => Warrant::CURRENT_STATUS,  // Warrant is active
    ]);
```

### 5. Expiration and Termination States

**Natural Expiration:**
- Automatic transition to `EXPIRED_STATUS` when `expires_on` date reached
- Handled by background processing (see `DefaultWarrantManager::expireOldWarrants()`)

**Administrative Termination:**
- `cancel()` method sets early expiration date and revocation reason
- `decline()` method marks entire roster as declined, warrants as cancelled
- `declineSingleWarrant()` method cancels individual warrants within roster

**Replacement:**
- New warrants automatically expire conflicting warrants
- Previous warrants marked as `REPLACED_STATUS` or expired

## 4.4 Approval Workflow Process

### Multi-Level Approval System

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Administrator Creates<br/>Warrant Roster] --> B[Roster Status: PENDING<br/>Warrants Status: PENDING]
    B --> C[Authorized User<br/>Provides Approval]
    C --> D{Required<br/>Approvals Met?}
    D -->|No| E[Record Approval<br/>Increment Counter]
    E --> F[Wait for More<br/>Approvals]
    F --> C
    D -->|Yes| G[Roster Status: APPROVED<br/>Warrants Status: CURRENT]
    G --> H[Expire Conflicting<br/>Warrants]
    H --> I[Queue Email<br/>Notifications]
    I --> J[Warrants Active<br/>Permissions Granted]
    
    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style G fill:#c8e6c9
    style J fill:#a5d6a7
```

1. **Warrant Roster Creation**
   - Administrator creates roster with multiple warrant requests
   - Roster status: `STATUS_PENDING`
   - Individual warrants status: `PENDING_STATUS`
   - Approval requirement set from configuration

2. **Approval Collection**
   - Authorized users provide approvals via `WarrantRostersController::approve()`
   - Each approval recorded in `WarrantRosterApprovals` table
   - Approval count incremented on roster

3. **Threshold Validation**
   - `WarrantRoster::hasRequiredApprovals()` checks approval count
   - When threshold met, roster status becomes `STATUS_APPROVED`

4. **Warrant Activation**
   - All pending warrants transition to `CURRENT_STATUS`
   - Automatic conflict resolution expires overlapping warrants
   - Email notifications sent to warrant recipients

### Approval Tracking

**Database Schema:**
```mermaid
erDiagram
    WARRANT_ROSTERS {
        int id PK
        string name
        text description
        string status
        int approval_count
        datetime created
        datetime modified
    }
    
    WARRANT_ROSTER_APPROVALS {
        int id PK
        int warrant_roster_id FK
        int approver_id FK
        datetime approved_on
    }
    
    WARRANTS {
        int id PK
        int warrant_roster_id FK
        int member_id FK
        int member_role_id FK
        string status
        datetime start_on
        datetime expires_on
        datetime approved_date
        string revoked_reason
        int revoker_id FK
    }
    
    MEMBERS {
        int id PK
        string first_name
        string last_name
    }
    
    WARRANT_ROSTERS ||--o{ WARRANT_ROSTER_APPROVALS : "has approvals"
    WARRANT_ROSTERS ||--o{ WARRANTS : "contains warrants"
    MEMBERS ||--o{ WARRANT_ROSTER_APPROVALS : "provides approval"
    MEMBERS ||--o{ WARRANTS : "receives warrant"
```

**Business Rules:**
- Same approver cannot approve multiple times
- Approval threshold configurable per system
- Complete audit trail of approval decisions

## 4.5 RBAC Integration

### Permission Validation Chain

When warrant-secured permissions are checked:

1. **Role Assignment Check:** Verify member has role through `MemberRole`
2. **Permission Check:** Verify role has required permission
3. **Warrant Validation:** If permission requires warrant, validate:
   - Active warrant exists for the member role assignment
   - Warrant status is `CURRENT_STATUS`
   - Current time within warrant's `start_on` and `expires_on` range
4. **Additional Validation:** Membership status, age requirements, etc.

### Configuration Control

**Warrant Requirement Toggle:**
- `KMP.RequireActiveWarrantForSecurity` - Global enable/disable
- Individual permissions can require warrants via `requires_warrant` flag
- Granular control per permission type and scope

### Security Enforcement

**PermissionsLoader Integration:**
```php
// Warrant validation subquery integrated into permission checking
$warrantSubquery = $warrantsTable->find()
    ->select(['member_role_id'])
    ->where([
        'start_on <' => $now,
        'expires_on >' => $now,
        'status' => Warrant::CURRENT_STATUS
    ]);

// Only member roles with valid warrants grant permissions
$memberRolesQuery->where(['MemberRoles.id IN' => $warrantSubquery]);
```

## 4.6 State Transitions

### Valid State Transitions

```mermaid

    [*] --> PENDING : request()
    
    PENDING --> CURRENT : approve()
    PENDING --> CANCELLED : decline()
    PENDING --> CANCELLED : cancel()
    
    CURRENT --> EXPIRED : expire()
    CURRENT --> DEACTIVATED : cancel()
    CURRENT --> REPLACED : replace()
    
    UPCOMING --> CURRENT : activate()
    
    CURRENT --> [*]
    EXPIRED --> [*]
    DEACTIVATED --> [*]
    CANCELLED --> [*]
    REPLACED --> [*]
    DECLINED --> [*]
    RELEASED --> [*]
    
    note right of PENDING
        Awaiting approval
        No permissions granted
    end note
    
    note right of CURRENT
        Active warrant
        Permissions granted
    end note
    
    note right of EXPIRED
        Natural expiration
        No permissions granted
    end note
```

### Transition Triggers

| Transition | Method | Actor | Validation |
|------------|--------|-------|------------|
| None → Pending | `request()` | Administrator | Member warrantability, period validity |
| Pending → Current | `approve()` | Approver | Required approvals met |
| Pending → Cancelled | `decline()` or `cancel()` | Administrator | Roster status validation |
| Current → Expired | Automatic | System | Date-based expiration |
| Current → Deactivated | `cancel()` | Administrator | Manual termination |
| Current → Replaced | `approve()` new warrant | System | Conflict resolution |

## 4.7 Administrative Operations

### WarrantManager Service Methods

**Request Creation:**
```php
public function request($request_name, $desc, $warrantRequests): ServiceResult
```
- Creates warrant roster with batch of warrant requests
- Validates member eligibility and warrant periods
- Uses database transactions for atomicity

**Approval Processing:**
```php
public function approve($warrant_roster_id, $approver_id): ServiceResult
```
- Records approval vote for warrant roster
- Activates warrants when threshold met
- Handles automatic conflict resolution and notifications

**Decline Operations:**
```php
public function decline($warrant_roster_id, $rejecter_id, $reason): ServiceResult
```
- Rejects entire warrant roster
- Cancels all contained warrants
- Records decline reason in audit trail

**Individual Warrant Management:**
```php
public function cancel($warrant_id, $reason, $rejecter_id, $expiresOn): ServiceResult
public function cancelByEntity($entityType, $entityId, $reason, $rejecter_id, $expiresOn): ServiceResult
```
- Terminate specific warrants independent of roster
- Support for entity-based warrant cancellation
- Complete audit trail with revocation reasons

### Controller Operations

**WarrantRostersController methods:**
- `index()` - Dashboard and navigation interface
- `allRosters($state)` - Filtered roster listing with pagination
- `view($id)` - Detailed roster view with approval tracking
- `add()` - Create new warrant roster
- `edit($id)` - Modify existing roster
- `approve($id)` - Process roster approval
- `decline($id)` - Decline entire roster
- `declineWarrantInRoster($roster_id, $warrant_id)` - Individual warrant decline

## 4.8 Security Architecture

### Authorization Controls

**Policy-Based Access:**
- All warrant operations subject to authorization policies
- Entity-level authorization on specific warrants and rosters
- Branch scoping ensures organizational data isolation

**Request Security:**
- POST-only requirements for state-changing operations
- CSRF protection through request method validation
- Identity verification for all approval operations

### Audit Trail

**Complete Tracking:**
- All warrant state changes logged with user identity
- Approval decisions recorded with timestamps
- Revocation reasons and administrative actions tracked

**Database Audit Fields:**
- `created_by`, `modified_by` - User accountability
- `created`, `modified` - Timestamp tracking
- `revoked_reason`, `revoker_id` - Termination audit
- `approved_date` - Approval timestamp

### Data Integrity

**Transactional Operations:**
- Warrant roster creation uses database transactions
- Approval processing ensures atomicity
- Conflict resolution prevents data corruption

**Validation Rules:**
- Member warrantability requirements
- Temporal consistency between warrants and membership
- Approval threshold enforcement

## 4.9 Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization

**Indexing Strategy:**
- Temporal queries optimized with date range indexes
- Member role associations indexed for permission validation
- Status fields indexed for state filtering

**Query Optimization:**
- Subquery patterns for warrant validation
- Selective field loading for list views
- Efficient joins for related data

### Caching Integration

**Security Cache:**
- Warrant changes trigger security cache invalidation
- Permission validation results cached where appropriate
- Branch-scoped cache invalidation for organizational data

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Dashboard metrics for pending warrant counts
- Navigation badge integration for administrative alerts
- Optimized counting queries for status indicators

## 4.10 Integration Examples

### Creating Warrant Requests

```php
// Create warrant roster with multiple requests
$requests = [
    new WarrantRequest(
        'Branch Officer',           // name
        'Branches',                // entity_type
        $branchId,                 // entity_id
        $requesterId,              // requester_id
        $memberId,                 // member_id
        $startDate,                // start_on
        $endDate,                  // expires_on
        $memberRoleId              // member_role_id
    ),
];

$result = $warrantManager->request(
    'Q2 Officer Appointments',     // roster name
    'Quarterly officer appointments', // description
    $requests                      // warrant requests array
);
```

### Processing Approvals

```php
// Approve warrant roster
$result = $warrantManager->approve($rosterId, $approverId);

if ($result->success) {
    // Check if roster now has required approvals
    $roster = $warrantsTable->get($rosterId);
    if ($roster->hasRequiredApprovals()) {
        // All warrants are now active
    }
}
```

### Permission Validation

```php
// Check warrant-secured permission
$hasPermission = $member->checkCan('manage.events', 'Activities');

// This internally validates:
// 1. Member has role with 'manage.events' permission
// 2. Valid warrant exists for the role assignment (if required)
// 3. Warrant is in CURRENT_STATUS and within time bounds
// 4. All other permission requirements met
```

### Administrative Operations

```php
// Cancel specific warrant
$result = $warrantManager->cancel(
    $warrantId,                    // warrant ID
    'Officer resigned',            // reason
    $revokerId,                    // revoker ID
    new DateTime('+1 day')         // expiration date
);

// Decline entire roster
$result = $warrantManager->decline(
    $rosterId,                     // roster ID
    $rejectorId,                   // rejector ID
    'Insufficient qualifications'  // reason
);
```
