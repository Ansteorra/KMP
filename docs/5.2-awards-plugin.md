```

## Award Recommendation Workflow

The Awards plugin implements a sophisticated dual-tracking state machine for managing recommendation workflows:

### Status/State Dual Tracking System

The system uses both **Status** (high-level category) and **State** (specific workflow position) for granular control:

#### Status Categories

- **In Progress**: Active recommendations being processed
- **Scheduling**: Recommendations approved and needing ceremony assignment
- **To Give**: Recommendations scheduled for presentation
- **Closed**: Completed or terminated recommendations

#### Detailed State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Submitted
    
    state InProgress {
        state "In Progress" as IP
        Submitted --> InConsideration: Review Started
        InConsideration --> AwaitingFeedback: Need Information
        AwaitingFeedback --> InConsideration: Information Received
        InConsideration --> DeferredTillLater: Delayed
        DeferredTillLater --> InConsideration: Review Resumed
        InConsideration --> KingApproved: Crown Approval
        InConsideration --> QueenApproved: Crown Approval
        KingApproved --> QueenApproved: Joint Approval
        QueenApproved --> KingApproved: Joint Approval
    }
    
    KingApproved --> NeedToSchedule: Ready for Event
    QueenApproved --> NeedToSchedule: Ready for Event
    
    state Scheduling {
        NeedToSchedule --> Scheduled: Event Assigned
    }
    
    state ToGive {
        state "To Give" as TG
        Scheduled --> AnnouncedNotGiven: Court Announced
        AnnouncedNotGiven --> Given: Award Presented
    }
    
    state Closed {
        Given --> [*]
        NoAction --> [*]
    }
    
    Submitted --> NoAction: Declined
    InConsideration --> NoAction: Declined
    AwaitingFeedback --> NoAction: Declined
    DeferredTillLater --> NoAction: Declined
```

### State Rules and Business Logic

Each state has specific rules governing field visibility, requirements, and transitions:

#### State-Specific Rules

**Need to Schedule:**
- Shows event planning fields
- Disables award/member modification
- Requires event assignment for progression

**Scheduled:**
- Requires assigned event
- Shows ceremonial planning fields
- Enables stack ranking for ceremony order

**Given:**
- Requires event assignment and given date
- Shows completion fields
- Automatically sets close reason to "Given"

**No Action:**
- Requires close reason explanation
- Disables most fields except closure details
- Represents declined or withdrawn recommendations

### Workflow Integration Points

#### Event Management Integration
- **Temporal Validation**: Events have open/close dates for recommendation processing
- **Ceremony Coordination**: Recommendations scheduled for specific events
- **Automatic Processing**: Event-based recommendation state transitions
- **Stack Ranking**: Priority ordering for ceremony presentation

#### Member Management Integration
- **Requester Tracking**: Links to submitting member or public contact
- **Subject Validation**: Verifies recommended member eligibility
- **Contact Management**: Maintains communication channels for coordination
- **Profile Synchronization**: Member data integration for court protocol

#### Administrative Workflows
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-selection state transitions with transaction safety
- **Queue Management**: Status-based processing queues
- **Oversight Capabilities**: Administrative review and approval controls

## Award Hierarchy Management
