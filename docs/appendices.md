## A. Troubleshooting

Common issues encountered during development and deployment, with their solutions.

### Database Connection Issues

**Issue**: Unable to connect to the database  
**Solution**: 
- Verify database credentials in `config/app_local.php`
- Check that the MySQL/MariaDB server is running
- Ensure the specified database exists and the user has proper permissions
- Check for IP restrictions on the database server

**Issue**: Migration fails with foreign key errors  
**Solution**:
- Ensure migrations are run in the correct order (core first, then plugins in their defined order)
- Verify that referenced tables exist before creating foreign keys
- Check for typos in table or column names

### Authentication Problems

**Issue**: Unable to log in despite correct credentials  
**Solution**:
- Check for proper session configuration
- Verify the user account is active
- Clear browser cookies and cache
- Check for PHP session garbage collection issues

**Issue**: Unexpected "Access Denied" messages  
**Solution**:
- Verify the user has the required role and permissions
- Check permission policies for conditional authorization
- Look for scoping issues (branch-specific vs. global permissions)
- Enable debug mode temporarily to see authorization failures

### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Slow page loads  
**Solution**:
- Enable the SQL log and look for inefficient queries
- Optimize database indexes for frequently queried fields
- Enable CakePHP query caching
- Check for N+1 query problems and use containable associations

**Issue**: High memory usage  
**Solution**:
- Use pagination for large result sets
- Avoid loading unnecessary associations
- Optimize image sizes in the application
- Increase PHP memory limit if necessary

### Common Error Messages

**Error**: "SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] Connection refused"  
**Solution**: Database server is not running or is not accessible at the configured host/port

**Error**: "Error: An Internal Error Has Occurred"  
**Solution**: Enable debug mode to see detailed error information, check logs for details

**Error**: "Class 'App\Plugin\MyPlugin\...' not found"  
**Solution**: Verify plugin namespace and class names match directory structure, ensure plugin is properly loaded
