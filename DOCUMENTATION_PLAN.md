## Notes and Decisions

- Documentation follows KMP project coding standards from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Each component includes usage examples and integration patterns
- Visual diagrams (sequence, ER, flow) will be created for complex systems
- All documentation will be AI-friendly with clear structure and examples
- Regular reviews scheduled at end of each phase
