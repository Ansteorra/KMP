/**
 * Notes cell
 * 
 * View Cell responsible for displaying and managing notes attached to various entities
 * throughout the KMP application. Provides a reusable notes interface that can be
 * embedded in any view to show entity-specific notes with proper permission handling.
 * 
 * The cell handles both public and private notes, with visibility controlled by
 * user permissions. It provides functionality for displaying existing notes and
 * creating new ones through an integrated form interface.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Entity-agnostic notes system (works with any entity type)
 * - Public/private note visibility control  
 * - Author information display with notes
 * - Integrated note creation form
 * - Permission-based create/view controls
 * - Chronological note ordering
 * 
 * Template: templates/cell/Notes/display.php
 * 
 * @package App\View\Cell
 * @see \App\Model\Entity\Note Note entity definition
 * @see \App\Model\Table\NotesTable Notes table class
