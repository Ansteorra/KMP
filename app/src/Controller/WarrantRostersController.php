/**
 * WarrantRosters Controller - Batch Warrant Management and Multi-Level Approval Interface
 *
 * This controller provides the administrative interface for managing warrant roster batches,
 * handling multi-level approval workflows, and coordinating bulk warrant operations. It
 * integrates closely with the WarrantManager service to provide a comprehensive system for
 * efficient warrant batch processing and approval management.
 *
 * ## Core Functionality
 * - **Batch Roster Management**: Create, view, edit, and manage warrant roster batches
 * - **Multi-Level Approval Workflow**: Handle approval and decline operations for entire rosters
 * - **Individual Warrant Control**: Manage individual warrants within roster batches
 * - **Authorization Integration**: Policy-based authorization for roster access and operations
 * - **Service Layer Integration**: Seamless integration with WarrantManager for business logic
 * - **Administrative Oversight**: Comprehensive views and filtering for administrative management
 *
 * ## Controller Architecture
 * - **Authorization Component**: Integrated authorization with policy-based access control
 * - **Service Injection**: WarrantManager dependency injection for business logic operations
 * - **Scoped Data Access**: Branch-scoped authorization through Authorization component
 * - **Flash Messaging**: User feedback through Flash messages for operation results
 * - **Exception Handling**: Proper error handling with NotFoundException for missing resources
 *
 * ## Key Operations
 * - **CRUD Operations**: Complete roster lifecycle management with validation
 * - **Approval Processing**: Multi-step approval workflow with audit trail
 * - **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk warrant processing through roster system
 * - **Status Management**: Track roster states through approval workflow
 * - **Individual Warrant Management**: Fine-grained control over warrants within rosters
 *
 * ## Integration Points
 * - **WarrantManager Service**: Business logic for approval, decline, and warrant operations
 * - **Authorization Service**: Policy-based authorization for roster and warrant access
 * - **WarrantRostersTable**: Data layer for roster management and validation
 * - **Authentication Component**: User identity for audit trail and permission checking
 * - **Flash Component**: User feedback and operation status messaging
 *
 * ## Security Architecture
 * - **Policy-Based Authorization**: Each operation authorized through appropriate policies
 * - **Resource Authorization**: Entity-level authorization for individual rosters and warrants
 * - **Branch Scoping**: Automatic data scoping based on user's organizational access
 * - **Request Method Validation**: POST-only requirements for state-changing operations
 * - **Identity Verification**: Authentication required for all approval operations
 *
 * ## Usage Examples
 * ```php
 * // Create new warrant roster
 * $this->WarrantRosters->add([
 *     'name' => 'Pennsic War 52 Event Staff',
 *     'description' => 'Event staff warrants for Pennsic activities',
 *     'approvals_required' => 2,
 *     'planned_start_on' => '2025-07-15',
 *     'planned_expires_on' => '2025-08-15'
 * ]);
 *
 * // Approve roster through WarrantManager
 * $result = $warrantManager->approve($rosterId, $userId);
 * if ($result->success) {
 *     $this->Flash->success('Roster approved successfully');
 * }
 *
 * // Decline individual warrant in roster
 * $result = $warrantManager->declineSingleWarrant($warrantId, 'Reason', $userId);
 * ```
