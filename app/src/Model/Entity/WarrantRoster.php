/**
 * WarrantRoster Entity - Warrant Batch Management and Multi-Level Approval System
 *
 * The WarrantRoster entity represents a batch container for warrant approval workflows
 * within the KMP warrant system. This entity manages collections of warrants that require
 * coordinated approval from multiple authorized signers, providing a structured approach
 * to organizational warrant management and administrative oversight.
 *
 * **Core Architecture:**
 * - Extends BaseEntity for KMP framework integration and branch authorization
 * - Implements batch management for multiple warrant approvals
 * - Provides multi-level authorization workflow with configurable approval requirements
 * - Integrates with warrant approval tracking system for administrative oversight
 * - Supports temporal validation with planned start and expiration dates
 *
 * **Batch Management System:**
 * - Groups related warrants into manageable approval batches
 * - Provides centralized approval tracking and status management
 * - Enables bulk warrant operations for administrative efficiency
 * - Supports configurable approval requirements (approvals_required)
 * - Tracks current approval count for workflow status determination
 *
 * **Multi-Level Authorization:**
 * - Configurable number of required approvals (approvals_required field)
 * - Real-time approval count tracking (approval_count field)
 * - Automatic status determination based on approval workflow state
 * - Integration with WarrantRosterApproval entities for detailed tracking
 * - Support for decline actions that immediately affect roster status
 *
 * **Status Management System:**
 * - **Pending**: Awaiting required approvals (default state)
 * - **Approved**: All required approvals obtained (ready for warrant activation)
 * - **Declined**: At least one signer declined (workflow terminated)
 * - Automatic status calculation based on approval workflow progress
 * - Integration with warrant lifecycle for coordinated state management
 *
 * **Temporal Validation:**
 * - **planned_start_on**: Planned warrant activation date for batch
 * - **planned_expires_on**: Planned warrant expiration date for batch
 * - Provides temporal boundaries for warrant batch lifecycle
 * - Enables administrative planning and coordination of warrant periods
 * - Supports organizational scheduling and resource management
 *
 * **Approval Workflow Integration:**
 * - Links to WarrantRosterApproval entities for detailed approval tracking
 * - Supports multiple authorized signers with individual approval records
 * - Provides hasRequiredApprovals() method for workflow status checking
 * - Enables administrative oversight of approval progress
 * - Integrates with member authorization system for signer validation
 *
 * **Warrant Association:**
 * - Serves as container for multiple Warrant entities
 * - Provides batch coordination for related warrant operations
 * - Enables bulk warrant processing and administrative efficiency
 * - Supports organizational warrant management workflows
 * - Links individual warrants to coordinated approval processes
 *
 * **Database Schema:**
 * ```sql
 * warrant_rosters:
 *   id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT       -- Unique roster identifier
 *   name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL              -- Descriptive roster name
 *   description TEXT                        -- Detailed roster description
 *   approvals_required INT NOT NULL         -- Number of required approvals
 *   approval_count INT DEFAULT 0            -- Current approval count
 *   status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending'    -- Workflow status
 *   planned_start_on DATETIME NOT NULL      -- Planned activation date
 *   planned_expires_on DATETIME NOT NULL    -- Planned expiration date
 *   created_by INT                          -- Creator member ID
 *   created DATETIME NOT NULL               -- Creation timestamp
 *   modified DATETIME                       -- Last modification
 *   modified_by INT                         -- Last modifier member ID
 * ```
 *
 * **Usage Examples:**
 * ```php
 * // Creating a warrant roster for batch approval
 * $warrantRoster = new WarrantRoster([
 *     'name' => 'Q1 2024 Officer Warrants',
 *     'description' => 'Quarterly warrant batch for new officers',
 *     'approvals_required' => 3,           // Requires 3 approvals
 *     'planned_start_on' => '2024-01-01',
 *     'planned_expires_on' => '2024-03-31'
 * ]);
 * 
 * // Checking approval status
 * if ($warrantRoster->hasRequiredApprovals()) {
 *     // Roster has sufficient approvals for warrant activation
 *     $warrantRoster->status = WarrantRoster::STATUS_APPROVED;
 * }
 * 
 * // Status checking for workflow management
 * switch ($warrantRoster->status) {
 *     case WarrantRoster::STATUS_PENDING:
 *         // Continue approval workflow
 *         break;
 *     case WarrantRoster::STATUS_APPROVED:
 *         // Activate associated warrants
 *         break;
 *     case WarrantRoster::STATUS_DECLINED:
 *         // Handle declined roster
 *         break;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * **Administrative Operations:**
 * ```php
 * // Bulk warrant processing through roster
 * $rosterId = 123;
 * $warrantsTable = TableRegistry::getTableLocator()->get('Warrants');
 * $rosterWarrants = $warrantsTable->find()
 *     ->where(['warrant_roster_id' => $rosterId])
 *     ->contain(['Members', 'MemberRoles'])
 *     ->toArray();
 * 
 * // Approval workflow management
 * $approvalsTable = TableRegistry::getTableLocator()->get('WarrantRosterApprovals');
 * $pendingApprovals = $approvalsTable->find()
 *     ->where([
 *         'warrant_roster_id' => $rosterId,
 *         'approved' => null  // Pending approvals
 *     ])
 *     ->contain(['Members'])
 *     ->toArray();
 * ```
 *
 * **Integration Points:**
 * - **Warrants**: Multiple warrants belong to a single roster
 * - **WarrantRosterApprovals**: Detailed approval tracking records
 * - **Members**: Creator and modifier tracking through audit trail
 * - **Authorization System**: Integration with KMP RBAC for signer validation
 * - **Temporal System**: Coordinate with warrant period management
 *
 * **Business Logic Considerations:**
 * - Approval count must match or exceed approvals_required for approval
 * - Single decline action can terminate entire roster approval workflow
 * - Temporal boundaries guide warrant activation and expiration scheduling
 * - Administrative accountability through creator and modifier tracking
 * - Organizational workflow coordination through batch management
 *
 * **Security Features:**
 * - Mass assignment protection for sensitive fields
 * - Integration with authorization system for signer validation
 * - Audit trail support through creation and modification tracking
 * - Organizational access control through KMP security framework

    /**
     * Check if roster has obtained required approvals for workflow completion
     *
     * Evaluates whether the current approval count meets or exceeds the configured
     * approval requirements for this warrant roster. This method provides the core
     * business logic for determining when a roster approval workflow is complete
     * and warrants can be activated.
     *
     * **Approval Logic:**
     * - Compares current approval_count against approvals_required
     * - Returns true when sufficient approvals obtained
     * - Handles null approval_count as zero for safe comparison
     * - Provides foundation for status determination logic
     *
     * **Workflow Integration:**
     * - Used by administrative interfaces for status display
     * - Integrates with warrant activation workflows
     * - Supports automated roster status updates
     * - Enables conditional logic for approval processing
     *
     * **Business Rules:**
     * - Approval count must equal or exceed required approvals
     * - Single decline action can override approval status (handled separately)
     * - Zero approval_count treated as insufficient for workflow completion
     * - Administrative override capabilities through direct status management
     *
     * **Usage Examples:**
     * ```php
     * // Check approval status for workflow decisions
     * if ($warrantRoster->hasRequiredApprovals()) {
     *     // Proceed with warrant activation
     *     $this->activateRosterWarrants($warrantRoster);

     *     $this->requestAdditionalApprovals($warrantRoster);

     * // Administrative status management
     * $status = $warrantRoster->hasRequiredApprovals() 
     *     ? WarrantRoster::STATUS_APPROVED 
     *     : WarrantRoster::STATUS_PENDING;
     * ```
     *
     * **Integration Points:**
     * - WarrantRosterApproval entities for detailed approval tracking
     * - Administrative interfaces for status display
     * - Warrant activation workflows for conditional processing
     * - Approval notification systems for workflow coordination
     *
