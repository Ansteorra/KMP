Good day <?= $memberScaName ?>

The "<?= $warrantName ?>" warrant has been issued and is valid from <?= $warrantStart ?> to
<?= $warrantExpires ?>.

If this warrant is for an office that extends passed this warrant date, new warrants will be issued as needed.

This new warrant supersedes any previous warrants issued for for the subjects this warrant covers.

Thank you
