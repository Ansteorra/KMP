/**
 * GW Sharing Stimulus Controller
 * 
 * **Purpose**: Provides automated form submission functionality for GW (Group Warrant)
 * sharing toggle switches in Activities plugin authorization management interfaces.
 * 
 * **Core Responsibilities**:
 * - Automatic Form Submission - Immediate form submission on toggle change
 * - Toggle Switch Integration - Seamless switch state management
 * - User Experience Optimization - Instant feedback for setting changes
 * - Authorization Configuration - GW sharing preference management
 * 
 * **Architecture**: 
 * This Stimulus controller extends the base Controller to provide automatic
 * form submission when GW sharing toggle switches are changed, ensuring
 * immediate persistence of user preferences without manual form submission.
 * 
 * **Controller Configuration**:
 * ```html
 * <div data-controller="gw_sharing">
 *   <form data-gw_sharing-target="form" method="post" action="/activities/update-gw-sharing">
 *     <input type="checkbox" data-action="change->gw_sharing#submit">
 *     <!-- Other form fields -->
 *   </form>
 * </div>
 * ```
 * 
 * **GW Sharing Context**:
 * GW (Group Warrant) sharing allows authorization configurations to be
 * shared across organizational groups, affecting authorization workflows
 * and approval processes within the Activities plugin.
 * 
 * **User Experience Features**:
 * - **Instant Persistence**: Changes saved immediately on toggle
 * - **No Manual Submission**: Eliminates need for separate save button
 * - **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing form infrastructure
 * - **Consistent Behavior**: Standardized across GW sharing interfaces
 * 
 * **Toggle Switch Integration**:
 * - Responds to switch state changes immediately
 * - Preserves existing form data during submission
 * - Maintains form validation and security measures
 * - Supports multiple toggle switches per form
 * 
 * **Security Considerations**:
 * - Maintains CSRF token protection through form submission
 * - Preserves server-side validation workflows
 * - Respects authorization and permission checking
 * - Uses standard HTTP methods for security compliance
 * 
 * **Performance Features**:
 * - Minimal JavaScript footprint for efficiency
 * - Direct form submission without AJAX overhead
 * - Browser-native form handling for reliability
 * - No additional network requests beyond form submission
 * 
 * **Error Handling**:
 * - Browser-native form validation integration
 * - Server-side error handling through standard form responses
 * - Graceful degradation if JavaScript disabled
 * - Form state preservation on submission errors
 * 
 * **Integration Points**:
 * - Activities Authorization Forms - GW sharing configuration
 * - Toggle Switch Components - Automatic submission trigger
 * - Authorization Workflows - Group warrant sharing settings
 * - Form Infrastructure - Standard form submission handling
 * 
 * **Usage Examples**:
 * ```html
 * <!-- GW sharing toggle with automatic submission -->
 * <div data-controller="gw_sharing">
 *   <form data-gw_sharing-target="form" method="post">
 *     <label class="form-check">
 *       <input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input"
 *              data-action="change->gw_sharing#submit"
 *              name="gw_sharing_enabled">
 *       Enable GW Sharing
 *     </label>
 *   </form>
 * </div>
 * ```
 * 
 * **Accessibility Features**:
 * - Preserves keyboard navigation functionality
 * - Maintains screen reader compatibility
 * - Supports assistive technology integration
 * - Follows WCAG guidelines for form interactions
 * 
 * **Browser Compatibility**:
 * - Uses standard DOM APIs for broad compatibility
 * - No modern JavaScript features requiring polyfills
 * - Graceful degradation in older browsers
 * - Progressive enhancement approach
 * 
 * **Troubleshooting**:
 * - Verify form target configuration is correct
 * - Check form action URL and method settings
 * - Validate toggle switch event binding
 * - Monitor network requests for form submission

     * Submit Form Automatically
     * 
     * Triggers immediate form submission when GW sharing toggle switches

     * 
     * **Automatic Submission**:
     * - Called by toggle switch change events

     * 
     * **User Experience**:
     * Eliminates need for manual save actions by automatically
     * persisting toggle changes when users interact with switches,
     * providing immediate feedback and seamless preference management.
     * 
     * **Form Integration**:
     * Uses browser-native form submission to maintain compatibility
     * with existing server-side validation, error handling, and
