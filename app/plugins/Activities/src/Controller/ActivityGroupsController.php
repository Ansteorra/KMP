/**
 * # ActivityGroups Controller
 * 
 * Comprehensive activity group management controller providing complete CRUD operations for organizing
 * activities into categorical groups within the KMP Activities Plugin. This controller manages the 
 * organizational structure that allows activities to be grouped for administrative purposes, navigation,
 * and reporting analytics.
 * 
 * ## Controller Overview
 * 
 * The ActivityGroupsController serves as the primary administrative interface for managing activity groups,
 * which provide organizational structure for the Activities plugin. Activity groups enable:
 * 
 * - **Categorical Organization**: Group related activities for easier management and discovery
 * - **Administrative Interface**: Streamlined interface for group management operations
 * - **Navigation Support**: Structured organization for user navigation and activity browsing
 * - **Reporting Analytics**: Grouped reporting and statistical analysis of activity participation
 * - **Future Extensibility**: Foundation for advanced grouping features and hierarchical organization
 * 
 * ## Architecture Integration
 * 
 * ### Activities Plugin Integration
 * ```php
 * // Activity groups provide organizational structure
 * $group = $this->ActivityGroups->get($id, contain: ['Activities']);
 * foreach ($group->activities as $activity) {
 *     // Process activities within group context
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Authorization Architecture
 * The controller integrates with KMP's comprehensive authorization system:
 * - **Policy-Based Access Control**: Entity-level authorization using ActivityGroupPolicy
 * - **Model-Level Authorization**: Automatic authorization for index and add operations
 * - **Entity Authorization**: Individual entity authorization for view, edit, and delete operations
 * - **Security Framework**: Integration with CakePHP Authorization plugin
 * 
 * ### Data Management Integration
 * ```php
 * // Comprehensive activity group management
 * $groups = $this->ActivityGroups->find()
 *     ->contain(['Activities'])
 *     ->orderAsc('name');
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Security Architecture
 * 
 * ### Authorization Framework
 * - **Model Authorization**: Automatic authorization for collection operations (index, add)
 * - **Entity Authorization**: Individual authorization for entity-specific operations
 * - **Policy Integration**: ActivityGroupPolicy provides granular access control
 * - **Administrative Controls**: Restricted access to authorized personnel only
 * 
 * ### Data Protection
 * - **Soft Deletion Pattern**: Activity groups are marked as deleted rather than hard deleted
 * - **Referential Integrity**: Prevents deletion of groups with associated activities
 * - **Audit Trail**: Integration with ActivityGroupsTable audit behaviors
 * - **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation through ActivityGroupsTable
 * 
 * ## Performance Considerations
 * 
 * ### Database Optimization
 * - **Selective Loading**: Strategic use of contain parameter for relationship loading
 * - **Pagination Support**: Built-in pagination for large datasets
 * - **Query Optimization**: Efficient queries for group and activity relationships
 * - **Index Utilization**: Leverages database indexes for name-based sorting
 * 
 * ### Caching Strategy
 * - **Activity Relationships**: Cached activity associations for performance
 * - **Navigation Integration**: Cached group data for navigation components
 * - **Administrative Views**: Optimized loading for administrative interfaces
 * 
 * ## Business Logic
 * 
 * ### Group Management Rules
 * - **Unique Naming**: Activity group names must be unique across the system
 * - **Activity Association**: Groups can contain multiple activities
 * - **Deletion Protection**: Groups with associated activities cannot be deleted
 * - **Administrative Oversight**: All operations require appropriate authorization
 * 
 * ### Workflow Integration
 * - **Activity Organization**: Groups provide structure for activity discovery
 * - **Administrative Workflows**: Streamlined group management for administrators
 * - **Reporting Integration**: Groups enable categorized reporting and analytics
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ### Basic Group Management
 * ```php
 * // List all activity groups with pagination
 * $this->ActivityGroups->index();
 * 
 * // View specific group with activities
 * $this->ActivityGroups->view($groupId);
 * 
 * // Create new activity group
 * $this->ActivityGroups->add();
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Administrative Operations
 * ```php
 * // Edit existing group
 * $this->ActivityGroups->edit($groupId);
 * 
 * // Delete group (with validation)
 * $this->ActivityGroups->delete($groupId);
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Integration with Activities
 * ```php
 * // Access activities within group context
 * $group = $this->ActivityGroups->get($id, contain: ['Activities']);
 * $activityCount = count($group->activities);
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Integration Points
 * 
 * ### Activities Plugin Components
 * - **ActivitiesTable**: Activity-group relationship management

    /**
     * Initialize the ActivityGroups controller with authorization configuration and component setup.
     * 
     * This method establishes the foundational security and component configuration for activity group
     * management operations. It configures automatic model-level authorization for collection operations
     * and ensures proper integration with the Activities plugin security framework.
     * 
     * ## Authorization Configuration
     * 
     * The method configures automatic authorization for collection-level operations:
     * - **Index Authorization**: Automatic authorization for listing activity groups
     * - **Add Authorization**: Automatic authorization for creating new activity groups
     * - **Model-Level Security**: Ensures users have appropriate permissions before accessing operations
     * 
     * ## Security Architecture Integration
     * 
     * ### Automatic Model Authorization
     * ```php
     * // Configured automatically for these operations:
     * $this->Authorization->authorizeModel("index");  // List groups
     * $this->Authorization->authorizeModel("add");    // Create groups
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Entity-Level Authorization
     * Entity-specific operations (view, edit, delete) require explicit authorization in each method:
     * ```php
     * // Individual entity authorization (configured per method)
     * $this->Authorization->authorize($activityGroup);
     * ```
     * 
     * ## Integration Points
     * 
     * ### Parent Controller Integration

     * - **RBAC Integration**: Connects with KMP role-based access control system
     * - **Permission Validation**: Ensures users have appropriate activity group management permissions
     * 
     * ## Usage Examples
     * 
     * ### Automatic Authorization Flow
     * ```php
     * // Index operation - automatically authorized
     * public function index() {
     *     // Authorization already checked in initialize()
     *     $groups = $this->ActivityGroups->find();
     * }
     * 
     * // Add operation - automatically authorized
     * public function add() {
     *     // Authorization already checked in initialize()
     *     $group = $this->ActivityGroups->newEmptyEntity();
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Manual Authorization Required
     * ```php
     * // Entity operations require explicit authorization
     * public function view($id) {
     *     $group = $this->ActivityGroups->get($id);
     *     $this->Authorization->authorize($group); // Required
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * ## Security Considerations
     *

    /**
     * Delete activity group with comprehensive validation and referential integrity protection.
     * 
     * This method provides secure deletion of activity groups with comprehensive business rule validation
     * and referential integrity protection. It implements a soft deletion pattern with activity association
     * checking to prevent orphaned activities and maintain data integrity throughout the Activities plugin.
     * 
     * ## Method Overview
     * 
     * The delete method implements comprehensive group removal with:
     * - **Security Validation**: HTTP method restriction and authorization checks
     * - **Referential Integrity**: Prevention of deletion when activities are associated
     * - **Soft Deletion Pattern**: Name prefixing to indicate deleted status
     * - **Business Logic Protection**: Validation of deletion constraints and rules
     * - **User Feedback**: Clear messaging for successful and failed deletion attempts
     * 
     * ## Security Architecture
     * 
     * ### HTTP Method Protection
     * ```php
     * // Restrict to secure HTTP methods only
     * $this->request->allowMethod(["post", "delete"]);
     * 
     * // Prevents CSRF attacks and accidental deletions
     * // Requires explicit POST or DELETE request
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Authorization Framework
     * - **Entity Authorization**: Individual authorization for specific group deletion
     * - **Policy Integration**: ActivityGroupPolicy determines delete access for specific groups
     * - **Administrative Access**: Typically restricted to authorized administrative personnel
     * - **Existence Validation**: Confirms group exists before authorization and deletion attempts
     * 
     * ### Data Protection Strategy
     * - **Referential Integrity**: Prevents deletion of groups with associated activities
     * - **Soft Deletion**: Name modification rather than hard deletion for audit trail
     * - **Authorization Checks**: Multiple authorization points throughout deletion process
     * - **Exception Handling**: Secure error responses for unauthorized or failed deletions
     * 
     * ## Business Logic and Validation
     * 
     * ### Referential Integrity Protection
     * ```php
     * // Load group with activities to check associations
     * $authorizationGroup = $this->ActivityGroups->get($id, contain: ["Activities"]);
     * 
     * // Prevent deletion if activities are associated
     * if ($authorizationGroup->activities) {
     *     $this->Flash->error(__("Cannot delete group with associated activities"));
     *     return $this->redirect(["action" => "index"]);
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Soft Deletion Implementation
     * The method implements a soft deletion pattern:
     * - **Name Prefixing**: Adds "Deleted: " prefix to group name
     * - **Audit Trail**: Maintains deletion record for administrative oversight
     * - **Data Preservation**: Preserves historical data while indicating deleted status
     * - **Recovery Possibility**: Enables potential recovery through administrative tools
     * 
     * ### Business Rule Enforcement
     * - **Activity Association Check**: Ensures no activities are orphaned by deletion
     * - **Administrative Constraints**: Enforces business rules for group deletion
     * - **Data Integrity**: Maintains referential integrity across Activities plugin
     * - **Deletion Validation**: Comprehensive validation before deletion execution
     * 
     * ## Deletion Workflow
     * 
     * ### Pre-Deletion Validation
     * The method performs comprehensive validation:
     * ```php
     * // 1. HTTP method validation
     * $this->request->allowMethod(["post", "delete"]);
     * 
     * // 2. Entity existence validation
     * if (!$authorizationGroup) {
     *     throw new \Cake\Http\Exception\NotFoundException();
     * }
     * 
     * // 3. Activity association validation
     * if ($authorizationGroup->activities) {
     *     // Prevent deletion and redirect
     * }
     * 
     * // 4. Authorization validation
     * $this->Authorization->authorize($authorizationGroup);
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Deletion Execution
     * Upon successful validation:
     * ```php
     * // Soft deletion implementation
     * $authorizationGroup->name = "Deleted: " . $authorizationGroup->name;
     * 
     * // Execute deletion with error handling
     * if ($this->ActivityGroups->delete($authorizationGroup)) {
     *     $this->Flash->success(__("The Activity Group has been deleted."));
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * ## Error Handling and User Feedback
     * 
     * ### Comprehensive Error Management
     * The method handles multiple error scenarios:
     * - **Not Found Errors**: Clear 404 responses for non-existent groups
     * - **Authorization Errors**: Forbidden responses for unauthorized deletion attempts
     * - **Business Logic Errors**: Clear messaging for constraint violations
     * - **Database Errors**: Handling of save/delete operation failures
     * 
     * ### User Feedback Strategy
     * ```php
     * // Success feedback
     * $this->Flash->success(__("The Activity Group has been deleted."));
     * 
     * // Constraint violation feedback
     * $this->Flash->error(__(
     *     "The Activity Group could not be deleted because it has associated Activities."
     * ));
     * 
     * // General failure feedback
     * $this->Flash->error(__(
     *     "The Activity Group could not be deleted. Please, try again."
     * ));
     * ```
     * 
     * ## Performance Considerations
     * 
     * ### Database Optimization
     * - **Efficient Loading**: Strategic loading of group with activities for validation
     * - **Single Transaction**: Atomic deletion operation with rollback capability
     * - **Index Utilization**: Leverages primary key indexes for fast retrieval
     * - **Minimal Queries**: Optimized query pattern for deletion validation
     * 
     * ### Memory Management
     * - **Selective Loading**: Loads only necessary data for deletion validation
     * - **Efficient Processing**: Streamlined deletion workflow
     * - **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of loaded entities and associations
     * 
     * ## User Experience
     * 
     * ### Administrative Interface
     * - **Confirmation Required**: POST/DELETE requirement prevents accidental deletions
     * - **Clear Feedback**: Immediate feedback for deletion attempts
     * - **Constraint Explanation**: Clear messaging when deletion is prevented
     * - **Navigation Support**: Automatic redirection to appropriate interface
     * 
     * ### Workflow Integration
     * - **Administrative Workflow**: Seamless integration with group management tasks
     * - **Error Recovery**: Clear path forward when deletion is prevented
     * - **Status Indication**: Visual indication of deletion attempt results
     * - **Breadcrumb Maintenance**: Proper navigation hierarchy after deletion
     * 
     * ## Integration Points
     * 
     * ### Activities Plugin Integration
     * - **Activity Management**: Coordination with ActivitiesController for activity operations
     * - **Referential Integrity**: Integration with Activities plugin data consistency
     * - **Audit Integration**: Deletion tracking through plugin audit system
     * - **Administrative Tools**: Integration with administrative dashboard and monitoring
     * 
     * ### Navigation Integration
     * - **Administrative Navigation**: Updated navigation after group deletion
     * - **Menu Updates**: Dynamic menu updates reflecting group availability
     * - **Breadcrumb Updates**: Proper breadcrumb management during deletion workflow
     * 
     * ## Usage Examples
     * 
     * ### Administrative Deletion
     * ```php
     * // Administrator initiates group deletion
     * // URL: /activities/activity-groups/delete/1 (POST request)
     * // Validates constraints and executes deletion
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Constraint Violation Handling
     * ```php
     * // Deletion prevented due to associated activities
     * // User receives clear error message
     * // Redirected to index with explanation
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Template Integration
     * ```php
     * // Deletion confirmation form
     * echo $this->Form->postLink('Delete Group', [
     *     'action' => 'delete',
     *     $group->id
     * ], [
     *     'confirm' => 'Are you sure you want to delete this group?',
     *     'method' => 'delete'
     * ]);
     * ```
     *
