/**
 * Activities Plugin Reports Controller
 *
 * Provides comprehensive reporting functionality for member activity authorizations
 * within the KMP Activities Plugin ecosystem. This controller generates analytics
 * and detailed reports for activity participation tracking, organizational oversight,
 * and compliance monitoring across the branch hierarchy.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Authorization Reports**: Generate comprehensive reports showing member authorization status
 * - **Branch-Scoped Analytics**: Filter reports by organizational hierarchy (branches)
 * - **Temporal Filtering**: Generate reports for specific date ranges and validity periods
 * - **Activity Analytics**: Aggregate statistics and member counts by activity type
 * - **Member Participation**: Detailed member listings with authorization details
 * - **Export Capabilities**: Data formatted for administrative review and export
 *
 * ## Authorization Architecture
 *
 * The controller integrates with the KMP authorization framework through:
 * - Policy-based access control via `ReportsControllerPolicy`
 * - URL-based authorization checking with `authorizeCurrentUrl()`
 * - Branch-scoped data filtering based on user permissions
 * - Activity-specific permission validation
 *
 * ## Reporting Scope
 *
 * Reports can be filtered and scoped by:
 * - **Temporal Range**: Valid authorization dates and expiration periods
 * - **Branch Hierarchy**: Organizational units with nested tree support
 * - **Activity Selection**: Multiple activity types with checkbox selection
 * - **Member Status**: Active authorizations vs expired/pending statuses
 *
 * ## Data Integration
 *
 * The controller integrates with multiple data sources:
 * - Activities.Authorizations: Core authorization records
 * - Activities.Activities: Activity definitions and configuration
 * - Branches: Organizational hierarchy for scoping
 * - Members: Member identity and profile information
 *
 * ## Performance Considerations
 *
 * - Uses efficient query building with selective field loading
 * - Implements branch hierarchy filtering at the database level
 * - Aggregates statistics using database functions for performance
 * - Supports large datasets with optimized JOIN operations
 *
 * ## Usage Examples
 *
 * ### Basic Authorization Report
 * ```php
 * // Generate report for all activities, current date
 * $this->request = $this->request->withQueryParams([
 *     'validOn' => date('Y-m-d'),
 *     'activities' => [1, 2, 3], // Activity IDs
 *     'branches' => 5 // Branch ID
 * ]);
 * $result = $this->authorizations();
 * ```
 *
 * ### Branch-Scoped Reporting
 * ```php
 * // Report for specific branch and children
 * $branchId = 10;
 * $validBranches = $this->Branches->find('children', for: $branchId)
 *     ->all()->extract('id')->toArray();
 * // Controller automatically includes child branches
 * ```
 *
 * ### Temporal Authorization Queries
 * ```php
 * // Query authorizations valid on specific date
 * $validOn = new DateTime('2024-06-01');
 * $query = $this->Authorizations->find()
 *     ->where([
 *         'OR' => [
 *             'start_on <=' => $validOn,
 *             'start_on IS' => null
 *         ],
 *         'expires_on >' => $validOn
 *     ]);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Administrative Features
 *
 * - **Member Count Analytics**: Distinct member counts across activities
 * - **Activity Rollup Statistics**: Aggregated participation by activity type
 * - **Detailed Member Listings**: Complete authorization details with member profiles
 * - **Branch Filtering**: Hierarchical organization filtering with tree support
 * - **Export-Ready Formatting**: Data structured for CSV export and reporting
 *
 * ## Integration Points
 *
 * - **Activities Plugin**: Core authorization and activity management
 * - **Branch Hierarchy**: Organizational scoping and tree navigation
 * - **Member Management**: Profile integration and membership tracking
 * - **Authorization Framework**: Policy-based access control
 * - **Dashboard System**: Navigation and reporting interface integration

    /**
     * Initialize the Reports Controller
     *
     * Configures the controller with authorization settings and security policies.
     * Currently uses manual authorization checking via `authorizeCurrentUrl()` rather
     * than automatic model authorization for flexible policy control.
     *
     * ## Authorization Configuration
     *
     * The controller implements manual authorization checking to provide fine-grained
     * control over report access. This allows for:
     * - Custom authorization logic per action
     * - Branch-specific report scoping
     * - Activity-based permission validation
     * - Administrative oversight controls
     *
     * ## Future Enhancement
     *
     * The commented authorization configuration suggests future implementation of
     * automatic model-level authorization for standard CRUD operations.

    /**
     * Generate Comprehensive Activity Authorization Report
     *
     * Provides detailed analytics and reporting for member activity authorizations
     * across the organizational hierarchy. This method supports complex filtering
     * by date range, branch scope, and activity selection to generate targeted
     * reports for administrative oversight and compliance monitoring.
     *
     * ## Query Parameters
     *
     * - **validOn**: Target date for authorization validity (default: tomorrow)
     * - **activities**: Array of activity IDs to include in report
     * - **branches**: Branch ID for organizational scoping (includes children)
     *
     * ## Report Components
     *
     * ### Statistical Summary
     * - **Distinct Member Count**: Total unique members with valid authorizations
     * - **Activity Rollup**: Aggregate participation counts by activity type
     * - **Branch Coverage**: Authorization distribution across organizational units
     *
     * ### Detailed Member Listing
     * - Complete member profiles with authorization details
     * - Temporal validity information (start/end dates)
     * - Branch affiliation and organizational context
     * - Activity-specific authorization status
     *
     * ## Authorization Workflow
     *
     * 1. **Policy Validation**: Verify user permissions via `authorizeCurrentUrl()`
     * 2. **Parameter Processing**: Extract and validate query parameters
     * 3. **Branch Scoping**: Calculate valid branches including hierarchy children
     * 4. **Data Aggregation**: Generate statistics and member listings
     * 5. **View Preparation**: Format data for template rendering
     *
     * ## Database Optimization
     *
     * The method implements several performance optimizations:
     * - **Selective Field Loading**: Only loads required fields for each table
     * - **Efficient JOINs**: Uses CakePHP's `contain()` for optimized associations
     * - **Database Aggregation**: Leverages SQL functions for statistical calculations
     * - **Branch Filtering**: Applies hierarchy filtering at the database level
     *
     * ## Data Processing Flow
     *
     * ```php
     * // 1. Authorization and setup
     * $this->authorizeCurrentUrl();
     * $validOn = DateTime::now()->addDays(1);
     * 
     * // 2. Branch hierarchy resolution
     * $validBranches = $branchesTbl->find('children', for: $branchId)
     *     ->all()->extract('id')->toArray();
     * 
     * // 3. Authorization filtering
     * $authQuery = $authTbl->find()
     *     ->where(['start_on <=' => $validOn, 'expires_on >' => $validOn])
     *     ->where(['activity_id IN' => $activities]);
     * 
     * // 4. Statistical aggregation
     * $memberCount = $authQuery->distinct('member_id')->count();
     * $rollup = $authQuery->groupBy(['Activities.name'])->all();
     * ```
     *
     * ## Template Variables
     *
     * The method sets the following variables for view rendering:
     * - **activitiesList**: Available activities for filter selection
     * - **branchesList**: Branch hierarchy for organizational filtering
     * - **distincMemberCount**: Total unique authorized members
     * - **validOn**: Target date for report validity
     * - **memberRollup**: Statistical summary by activity type
     * - **memberListQuery**: Detailed member authorization listings
     * - **activities**: Selected activity IDs for filtering
     *
     * ## Security Architecture
     *
     * - **Policy-Based Access**: Uses `ReportsControllerPolicy` for authorization
     * - **Branch Scoping**: Restricts data access based on organizational hierarchy
     * - **Parameter Validation**: Sanitizes and validates all query parameters
     * - **SQL Injection Prevention**: Uses parameterized queries and ORM methods
     *
     * ## Administrative Features
     *
     * ### Filter Interface
     * - Date picker for temporal filtering
     * - Branch selector with hierarchical tree display
     * - Multi-select activity checkboxes with "select all" functionality
     *
     * ### Export Capabilities
     * - Data structured for CSV export
     * - Member listings with complete authorization details
     * - Statistical summaries for dashboard integration
     *
     * ## Error Handling
     *
     * The method handles various error conditions:
     * - Invalid date parameters default to current date + 1 day
     * - Missing activity selection defaults to all available activities
     * - Empty branch selection processes without branch filtering
     * - Database errors are logged and handled gracefully
     *
     * ## Performance Considerations
     *
     * For large datasets, consider:
     * - Implementing pagination for member listings
     * - Adding database indexes for temporal queries
     * - Caching branch hierarchy calculations
     * - Using background processing for complex reports
     *
     * ## Integration Examples
     *
     * ### Dashboard Widget
     * ```php
     * // Generate summary statistics for dashboard
     * $reportData = $this->requestAction('/activities/reports/authorizations', [
     *     'query' => ['validOn' => date('Y-m-d')]
     * ]);
     * ```
     *
     * ### Automated Reporting
     * ```php
     * // Generate weekly authorization reports
     * $cronTask = function() {
     *     $this->authorizations();
     *     $this->exportToCsv($this->viewBuilder()->getVars());
     * };
     * ```

    /**
     * Apply Temporal Validity Filter to Authorization Queries
     *
     * Provides a reusable method for filtering authorization records based on
     * temporal validity. This method implements the business logic for determining
     * whether an authorization is valid on a specific date, considering both
     * start dates and expiration dates with proper null handling.
     *
     * ## Temporal Logic
     *
     * An authorization is considered valid on a given date if:
     * 1. **Start Date**: Either started on/before the target date OR has no start date (null)
     * 2. **End Date**: Either expires after the target date OR has no expiration (null)
     *
     * ## Null Handling
     *
     * The method properly handles null dates:
     * - **Null start_on**: Authorization is always valid from start perspective
     * - **Null expires_on**: Authorization never expires (permanent authorization)
     *
     * ## Query Structure
     *
     * ```sql
     * WHERE (
     *     (start_on <= $validOn OR start_on IS NULL)
     *     AND
     *     (expires_on >= $validOn OR expires_on IS NULL)
     * )
     * ```
     *
     * ## Usage Examples
     *
     * ### Basic Temporal Filtering
     * ```php
     * $query = $this->Authorizations->find();
     * $filteredQuery = $this->setValidFilter($query, new DateTime('2024-06-01'));
     * ```
     *
     * ### Complex Authorization Queries
     * ```php
     * $validAuths = $this->Authorizations->find()
     *     ->where(['member_id' => $memberId])
     *     ->where(['activity_id' => $activityId]);
     * $currentAuths = $this->setValidFilter($validAuths, DateTime::now());
     * ```
     *
     * ### Batch Processing
     * ```php
     * foreach ($dateRanges as $date) {
     *     $dailyAuths = $this->setValidFilter($baseQuery, $date);
     *     $this->processDailyReport($dailyAuths->all());
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ## Business Logic Integration
     *
     * This method encapsulates critical business logic for:
     * - **Authorization Validity**: Determining active authorizations
     * - **Temporal Reporting**: Generating time-based analytics
     * - **Compliance Checking**: Validating authorization status
     * - **Audit Trails**: Historical authorization analysis
     *
     * ## Performance Considerations
     *
     * - Uses database-level filtering for optimal performance
     * - Supports compound indexes on (start_on, expires_on) columns
     * - Minimizes data transfer by filtering at query level
     * - Compatible with CakePHP's query optimization features
     *
     * ## Error Handling
     *
     * The method assumes:
     * - Valid DateTime object for $validOn parameter
     * - Properly initialized Query object
     * - Existing start_on and expires_on columns in the table
     *
     * @param \Cake\ORM\Query $q The base query object to filter
     * @param \Cake\I18n\DateTime $validOn The target date for validity checking
     * @return \Cake\ORM\Query The modified query with temporal filters applied
     * @see \Activities\Model\Table\AuthorizationsTable For authorization data structure
     * @see \Cake\I18n\DateTime For date handling utilities
