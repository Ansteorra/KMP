/**
 * Default Authorization Manager Service
 * 
 * **Purpose**: Production implementation of AuthorizationManagerInterface providing comprehensive
 * authorization lifecycle management, multi-level approval workflows, and temporal validation
 * for Activities plugin member authorization system.
 * 
 * **Core Responsibilities**:
 * - Authorization Request Processing - Complete authorization request lifecycle management
 * - Multi-Level Approval Workflows - Sequential approval chains with forwarding logic
 * - Authorization Status Management - Approval, denial, and revocation operations
 * - Email Notification System - Automated approver and requester notifications
 * - ActiveWindow Integration - Temporal validation and automatic role assignment
 * - Transaction Management - Database consistency and rollback protection
 * 
 * **Architecture**: 
 * This service implements the AuthorizationManagerInterface contract and provides the core
 * business logic for authorization workflows within the Activities plugin. It integrates with
 * multiple KMP systems including the ActiveWindowManager for temporal validation, the email
 * system for notifications, and the RBAC system for automatic role assignment.
 * 
 * **Authorization Workflow**:
 * ```
 * Request → Pending → (Multi-Level Approvals) → Approved/Denied → Active/Expired/Revoked
 * ```
 * 
 * **Business Logic Features**:
 * - Renewal vs. New Authorization validation
 * - Duplicate request prevention
 * - Multi-approver sequential workflows
 * - Secure token-based email approval
 * - Automatic role assignment on approval
 * - Temporal expiration management
 * - Comprehensive audit trail
 * 
 * **Security Implementation**:
 * - Database transaction management for consistency
 * - Secure token generation for email-based approvals
 * - Validation of approver permissions
 * - Prevention of duplicate or conflicting requests
 * - Audit trail for all authorization actions
 * 
 * **Integration Points**:
 * - AuthorizationManagerInterface - Service contract compliance
 * - ActiveWindowManagerInterface - Temporal validation and role management
 * - MailerAwareTrait - Email notification system integration
 * - TableRegistry - Database table access and management
 * - ServiceResult - Standardized operation result patterns
 * - StaticHelpers - Token generation and utility functions
 * 
 * **Performance Considerations**:
 * - Database transaction management minimizes lock time
 * - Efficient query patterns for approval count validation
 * - Batch processing for multi-approval workflows
 * - Email notification batching for performance
 * 
 * **Usage Examples**:
 * 
 * ```php
 * // Authorization request processing
 * $result = $authManager->request(
 *     requesterId: 123,
 *     activityId: 456,
 *     approverId: 789,
 *     isRenewal: false
 * );
 * 
 * // Multi-level approval processing
 * $result = $authManager->approve(
 *     authorizationApprovalId: 100,
 *     approverId: 789,
 *     nextApproverId: 101  // For sequential approvals
 * );
 * 
 * // Authorization denial with audit trail
 * $result = $authManager->deny(
 *     authorizationApprovalId: 100,
 *     approverId: 789,
 *     denyReason: "Insufficient qualifications"
 * );
 * 
 * // Authorization revocation
 * $result = $authManager->revoke(
 *     authorizationId: 200,
 *     revokerId: 789,
 *     revokedReason: "Policy violation"
 * );
 * ```
 * 
 * **Error Handling**:
 * All methods return ServiceResult objects with detailed error messages and transaction
 * rollback on failure. Common error scenarios include validation failures, duplicate
 * requests, approver permission issues, and email notification failures.
 * 
 * **Troubleshooting**:
 * - Verify ActiveWindowManager service availability for temporal operations
 * - Check email configuration for notification delivery
 * - Validate approver permissions for authorization activities
 * - Monitor transaction logs for database consistency issues

     * **Business Logic**:
     * - Validates renewal eligibility (existing approved authorization required)
     * - Prevents duplicate pending requests for same activity

     * **Validation Rules**:
     * - Renewal: Must have existing approved authorization that hasn't expired
     * - Duplicate Prevention: No pending requests for same member/activity combination
     * - Approver Validation: Approver must have permission to authorize activity
     * 
     * **Transaction Management**:
