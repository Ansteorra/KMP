/**
 * Authorization Policy for Member Activity Authorizations
 *
 * This policy class defines authorization rules for Authorization entity operations within the KMP Activities plugin.
 * It provides comprehensive access control for member authorization requests, approvals, and lifecycle management
 * with both self-service capabilities and administrative oversight.
 *
 * **Purpose:**
 * - Controls access to Authorization entity operations through permission-based and ownership-based rules
 * - Provides self-service authorization for members managing their own activity authorizations
 * - Ensures proper administrative oversight for authorization workflows and approval processes
 * - Integrates with KMP's RBAC system for authorization management and approval authority validation
 *
 * **Authorization Architecture:**
 * - **Dual Authorization Model**: Combines ownership-based and permission-based authorization
 * - **Self-Service Access**: Members can manage their own authorization requests and renewals
 * - **Administrative Control**: Permission-based access for administrative and approval operations
 * - **Policy Framework Integration**: Dynamic policy evaluation through permission policy associations
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 * - **Ownership Validation**: Members have full access to their own authorization records
 * - **Permission Integration**: Administrative operations require appropriate permissions
 * - **Approval Authority**: Integration with activity-specific approval permission requirements
 * - **Workflow Security**: Proper access control for authorization lifecycle management
 * - **Audit Trail Support**: Authorization tracking with proper access control for historical data
 *
 * **Access Control Patterns:**
 * - **Member Self-Service**: Direct access for own authorization requests and renewals
 * - **Administrative Oversight**: Permission-based access for authorization management
 * - **Approval Authority**: Activity-specific permissions for authorization approval operations
 * - **Reporting Access**: Controlled access to authorization statistics and reporting data
 *
 * **Integration Points:**
 * - **PermissionsLoader**: Core permission validation and warrant checking for administrative access
 * - **BasePolicy**: Inherited permission discovery and policy framework integration
 * - **Authorization Controllers**: Access control for authorization workflow interfaces
 * - **Activity System**: Integration with activity-specific approval requirements and permissions
 *
 * **Security Considerations:**
 * - Members maintain privacy and control over their own authorization records
 * - Administrative access requires appropriate permission validation through RBAC system
 * - Approval operations integrate with activity-specific permission requirements
 * - Authorization viewing includes proper scope limitations for organizational privacy

    /**
     * Check if the user can revoke an authorization.
     *
     * Determines authorization for revoking member activity authorizations, providing access control
     * for administrative revocation operations and authorization lifecycle management.
     *
     * **Authorization Logic:**
     * - Delegates to permission-based policy evaluation through BasePolicy
     * - Requires appropriate administrative permissions for revocation authority
     * - Integrates with Activities plugin permission policy framework
     * - Supports warrant-based temporal validation for administrative roles
     *
     * **Permission Requirements:**
     * Typically requires permissions such as:
     * - "Activities.revoke": Direct authorization revocation authority
     * - "Activities.manage": General authorization management capabilities
     * - Activity-specific permissions: Based on the authorization's activity requirements
     *
     * **Usage Examples:**
     * ```php
     * // Controller authorization for revocation interface
     * $this->Authorization->authorize($authorization, 'revoke');
     * 
     * // Service-level authorization check
     * if ($this->Authorization->can($user, 'revoke', $authorization)) {
     *     $authorizationManager->revoke($authorization->id, $user->id, $reason);
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * **Security Considerations:**
     * - Revocation is typically restricted to administrative users with appropriate authority
     * - Integration with audit trail system for accountability and compliance
     * - Warrant validation ensures temporal authority for revocation operations

     *
     * **Authorization Logic:**
     * 1. **Self-Service Access**: Members can request authorizations for themselves
     * 2. **Administrative Access**: Users with appropriate permissions can request on behalf of others
     * 3. **Permission Validation**: Delegates to permission-based policy evaluation for administrative operations
     *
     * **Ownership-Based Access:**
     * - Direct access when `entity->member_id` matches requesting user's ID
     * - Enables self-service authorization request workflows
     * - Supports member autonomy in authorization management
     *
     * **Permission-Based Access:**
     * For administrative operations, typically requires permissions such as:
     * - "Activities.request": Authority to request authorizations for other members
     * - "Activities.manage": General authorization management capabilities
     * - Branch-scoped permissions: Organizational boundaries for authorization requests
     *
     * **Usage Examples:**
     * ```php
     * // Member requesting own authorization
     * $authorization = $this->Authorizations->newEntity(['member_id' => $currentUser->id]);
     * $this->Authorization->authorize($authorization, 'add'); // Returns true for own request

     * $this->Authorization->authorize($authorization, 'add'); // Requires permission validation
     * ```
     *
     * **Security Considerations:**
     * - Self-service access maintains member autonomy while ensuring proper identity verification

     * - Activity-specific permissions: Based on the authorization's activity requirements
     *
     * **Renewal Context:**
     * - Renewal requests typically maintain existing approval chains and requirements
     * - May have different approval requirements than initial authorization requests
     * - Supports continuous authorization maintenance for ongoing activities
     *
     * **Usage Examples:**
     * ```php
