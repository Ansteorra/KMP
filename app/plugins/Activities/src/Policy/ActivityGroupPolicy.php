/**
 * Activity Group Authorization Policy
 *
 * This policy class defines authorization rules for ActivityGroup entity operations within the KMP Activities plugin.
 * It extends the BasePolicy to inherit core RBAC functionality while providing activity group-specific authorization
 * logic for organizational categorization and administrative management of activity classifications.
 *
 * ## Purpose
 *
 * - **Group Management Authorization**: Controls access to activity group CRUD operations and organizational structure
 * - **Categorical Access Control**: Manages permissions for activity categorization and grouping operations
 * - **Administrative Oversight**: Governs access to activity group configuration and organizational management
 * - **RBAC Integration**: Seamless integration with KMP's role-based access control system
 * - **Organizational Structure**: Ensures proper authorization for activity organizational hierarchy management
 *
 * ## Authorization Architecture
 *
 * The policy leverages the BasePolicy framework to provide:
 * - **Permission-Based Access**: Uses KMP's permission system for activity group operation authorization
 * - **Entity-Level Authorization**: Granular access control for individual activity group operations
 * - **Warrant Integration**: Temporal validation through warrant requirements for administrative roles
 * - **Branch Scoping**: Organizational hierarchy support for activity group management permissions
 * - **Policy Framework**: Dynamic policy evaluation through permission policy associations
 *
 * ## Activity Group Operations Governed
 *
 * ### Administrative Operations
 * - **Group Creation**: Authorization for creating new activity categories and organizational groupings
 * - **Group Modification**: Permission validation for updating activity group properties and configuration
 * - **Group Deletion**: High-level administrative permissions for removing activity groups with referential integrity
 * - **Group Configuration**: Access control for activity group settings and organizational parameters
 *
 * ### Organizational Management
 * - **Category Assignment**: Permission validation for assigning activities to specific groups
 * - **Group Hierarchy**: Authorization for organizational structure management and group relationships
 * - **Navigation Integration**: Access control for activity group navigation and menu structure
 * - **Reporting Access**: Permission-based access to activity group analytics and reporting
 *
 * ## Security Implementation
 *
 * ### Permission Requirements
 * Activity group operations typically require permissions such as:
 * - **"Activities.manageGroups"**: General activity group administration and management
 * - **"Activities.createGroups"**: Permission for creating new activity categories
 * - **"Activities.configureGroups"**: Access to activity group configuration and settings
 * - **"Activities.deleteGroups"**: High-level permission for activity group removal
 * - **"Activities.organizeActivities"**: Permission for organizational structure management
 *
 * ### Authorization Patterns
 * ```php
 * // Entity-level authorization for group operations
 * $this->Authorization->authorize($activityGroup, 'edit');
 * 
 * // Policy-based authorization in administrative services
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($user, 'delete', $activityGroup)) {
 *     // Proceed with group deletion after referential integrity checks
 * }
 * 
 * // Creation authorization in controllers
 * $this->Authorization->authorize($this->ActivityGroups->newEmptyEntity(), 'add');
 * ```
 *
 * ## Integration Points
 *
 * - **BasePolicy**: Inherits core RBAC functionality and permission validation engine
 * - **PermissionsLoader**: Core permission validation and warrant checking for administrative operations
 * - **ActivityGroupsController**: Authorization enforcement for group management interfaces
 * - **Activities Management**: Integration with activity assignment and organizational operations
 * - **Navigation System**: Permission-based activity group navigation and menu generation
 *
 * ## Business Logic Considerations
 *
 * ### Referential Integrity
 * The policy considers business rules for activity group operations:
 * - **Active Activities**: Groups with assigned activities require special deletion permissions
 * - **System Groups**: Built-in activity groups may have additional protection requirements
 * - **Organizational Dependencies**: Groups used in organizational structure require careful modification control
 * - **Audit Requirements**: Administrative operations maintain audit trails for compliance
 *
 * ### Administrative Workflow
 * ```php
 * // Comprehensive group management workflow
 * public function manageActivityGroup($groupData)
 * {
 *     $group = $this->ActivityGroups->get($groupData['id']);
 *     
 *     // Entity-level authorization
 *     $this->Authorization->authorize($group, 'edit');
 *     
 *     // Check for dependent activities
 *     if ($group->hasActiveActivities() && $this->isStructuralChange($groupData)) {
 *         $this->Authorization->authorize($group, 'restructure');
 *     }
 *     
 *     return $this->processGroupUpdate($group, $groupData);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Performance Considerations
 *
 * - **Permission Caching**: Leverages security cache for repeated authorization checks
 * - **Lazy Loading**: Authorization checks performed only when necessary for group operations
 * - **Query Optimization**: Entity-level authorization integrated with efficient database queries
 * - **Batch Authorization**: Optimized permission checking for bulk group operations
 *
 * ## Usage Examples
 *
 * ### Controller Integration
 * ```php
 * // In ActivityGroupsController
 * public function edit($id)
 * {
 *     $activityGroup = $this->ActivityGroups->get($id);
 *     $this->Authorization->authorize($activityGroup);
 *     
 *     if ($this->request->is(['patch', 'post', 'put'])) {
 *         // Process group updates with authorization
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Service Layer Integration
 * ```php
 * // In activity organization services
 * public function reorganizeActivityGroups($newStructure)
 * {
 *     foreach ($newStructure as $groupId => $config) {
 *         $group = $this->ActivityGroups->get($groupId);
 *         $this->Authorization->authorize($group, 'configure');
 *         $this->updateGroupConfiguration($group, $config);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Administrative Operations
 * ```php
 * // Activity group deletion with referential integrity
 * public function deleteActivityGroup($groupId)
 * {
 *     $group = $this->ActivityGroups->get($groupId, contain: ['Activities']);
 *     
 *     // Authorization for deletion
 *     $this->Authorization->authorize($group, 'delete');
 *     
 *     // Additional authorization for groups with activities
 *     if (!$group->activities->isEmpty()) {
 *         $this->Authorization->authorize($group, 'forceDelete');
 *     }
 *     
 *     return $this->processGroupDeletion($group);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Error Handling
 *
 * The policy integrates with CakePHP's authorization framework to provide:
 * - **ForbiddenException**: Clear error messages for unauthorized group operations
 * - **Audit Logging**: Unauthorized access attempts logged for security monitoring
 * - **Referential Integrity**: Proper handling of group operations with dependent activities
 * - **User Feedback**: Clear indication of permission requirements for group management
 *
 * ## Best Practices
 *
 * - Always authorize activity group operations before modifying organizational structure
 * - Check for dependent activities before authorizing destructive group operations
 * - Implement proper error handling for unauthorized group access
 * - Cache permission results for performance in administrative interfaces
 * - Maintain audit trails for all administrative group operations
 * - Consider organizational impact when authorizing structural changes
