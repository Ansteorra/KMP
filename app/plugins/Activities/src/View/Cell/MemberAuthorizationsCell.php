/**
 * Member Authorizations View Cell
 * 
 * **Purpose**: Provides comprehensive member authorization dashboard functionality for 
 * member profile views, displaying current, pending, and historical authorization status
 * with age-appropriate activity suggestions and interactive management capabilities.
 * 
 * **Core Responsibilities**:
 * - Authorization Status Dashboard - Current, pending, and historical authorization counts
 * - Age-Appropriate Activity Discovery - Activity suggestions based on member age
 * - Authorization Lifecycle Visualization - Status-aware display with detailed information
 * - Interactive Authorization Management - Request initiation and status tracking
 * - Current User Identity Support - Self-service authorization management
 * 
 * **Architecture**: 
 * This view cell extends CakePHP Cell to provide reusable authorization dashboard
 * functionality that can be embedded in member profiles, administrative interfaces,
 * and self-service portals. It integrates with the Activities authorization system
 * and provides real-time authorization status information.
 * 
 * **Dashboard Features**:
 * - **Current Authorizations**: Active authorizations with expiration tracking
 * - **Pending Authorizations**: Authorization requests awaiting approval
 * - **Historical Authorizations**: Previous authorizations with status details
 * - **Available Activities**: Age-appropriate activities available for request
 * - **Authorization Statistics**: Summary counts for quick overview
 * 
 * **Member Context Support**:
 * - **Profile Integration**: Embedded in member profile views
 * - **Self-Service**: Current user authorization management (id = -1)
 * - **Administrative**: Manager access to member authorization status
 * - **Age-Based Filtering**: Activities filtered by member age requirements
 * 
 * **Status Visualization**:
 * Provides detailed status information including:
 * - Authorization approver information for pending requests
 * - Denial/revocation reasons with approver accountability
 * - Expiration status and timeline information
 * - Activity group organization for clarity
 * 
 * **Integration Points**:
 * - AuthorizationsTable - Authorization lifecycle management
 * - ActivitiesTable - Activity configuration and age requirements
 * - MembersTable - Member profile and age calculation
 * - Identity Service - Current user identification
 * - Authorization Status Constants - Status-aware display logic
 * 
 * **Performance Considerations**:
 * - Efficient count queries for dashboard statistics
 * - Age-based activity filtering at database level
 * - Selective field loading for member information
 * - Optimized contain patterns for association data
 * 
 * **Usage Examples**:
 * 
 * ```php
 * // Member profile integration
 * echo $this->cell('Activities.MemberAuthorizations', [$member->id]);
 * 
 * // Self-service authorization dashboard
 * echo $this->cell('Activities.MemberAuthorizations', [-1]); // Current user
 * 
 * // Administrative authorization overview
 * echo $this->cell('Activities.MemberAuthorizations', [$memberId]);
 * ```
 * 
 * **Template Integration**:
 * Renders tabbed interface with:
 * - Authorization status summary
 * - Current authorizations listing
 * - Pending requests with approver information
 * - Available activities for new requests
 * - Historical authorization timeline
 * 
 * **Security Features**:
 * - Identity-based access control for current user
 * - Age-appropriate activity filtering
 * - Status-aware information display
 * - Approval workflow transparency
 * 
 * **Error Handling**:
 * - Graceful handling of missing member data
 * - Empty state display for members without authorizations
 * - Age calculation validation and fallback
 * 
 * **Troubleshooting**:
 * - Verify member exists and has valid age information
 * - Check activity age requirements configuration
 * - Validate authorization table associations
 * - Monitor query performance for large authorization datasets

 * @see AuthorizationsTable Authorization lifecycle management

     * Display Member Authorization Dashboard
     *
     * Generates comprehensive authorization dashboard for specified member with
     * current status, pending requests, historical data, and available activities.
     * 
     * **Dashboard Components**:
     * - Current authorization count with active status
     * - Pending authorization count with approval tracking
     * - Historical authorization count for lifecycle view
     * - Age-appropriate activities available for request
     * - Member profile integration with age-based filtering
     * 
     * **Identity Management**:
     * - Special handling for id = -1 (current authenticated user)
     * - Identity service integration for self-service access
     * - Secure member identification and validation
     * 
     * **Age-Based Activity Filtering**:
     * Activities are filtered based on member's calculated age:
     * - minimum_age <= member.age <= maximum_age
     * - Prevents inappropriate activity suggestions
     * - Ensures compliance with activity requirements
     * 
     * **Performance Optimization**:
     * - Efficient count queries for dashboard statistics
     * - Selective field loading for member information
     * - Optimized activity discovery queries
     * - Minimal data transfer for dashboard rendering
     * 
     * **Data Preparation**:
     * Sets template variables:
     * - pendingAuthCount: Number of pending authorization requests
     * - isEmpty: Boolean indicating if member has any authorizations
     * - id: Member identifier for template linking
     * - activities: Age-appropriate activities available for request
     * - member: Member entity with profile information
     * 
     * @param int $id Member ID (-1 for current authenticated user)
     * @return void

     * Add Authorization Query Conditions
     * 
     * Enhances authorization queries with status-aware display logic, approver
     * information, and comprehensive authorization lifecycle data.
     * 
     * **Status-Aware Display Logic**:
     * Creates conditional expressions for authorization status display:
     * - DENIED: Shows rejection details with approver and reasoning
     * - REVOKED: Shows revocation details with revoker and reasoning  
     * - EXPIRED: Shows simple expiration message
     * - OTHER: Default empty display for active authorizations
     * 
     * **Query Enhancements**:
     * - Core authorization fields (id, member_id, activity_id, status)
     * - Temporal information (start_on, expires_on)
     * - Status-conditional reasoning display
     * - Comprehensive association data loading
     * 
     * **Association Loading**:
     * - CurrentPendingApprovals: Active approval workflow information
     * - Activities: Activity name and configuration details
     * - RevokedBy: Revoker identity for accountability
     * - Approvers: Approval workflow participant information
     * 
     * **Display Logic Features**:
     * - Concatenated status messages with context
     * - Approver accountability for decisions
     * - Temporal information integration
     * - Comprehensive audit trail display
