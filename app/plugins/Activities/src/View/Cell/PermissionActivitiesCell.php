/**
 * Permission Activities View Cell
 * 
 * **Purpose**: Provides activities listing for specific permissions in permission
 * detail views, showing which activities grant or require specific permissions
 * for authorization workflows and permission management.
 * 
 * **Core Responsibilities**:
 * - Permission-Activity Relationship Display - Activities that grant specific permissions
 * - Activity Group Organization - Hierarchical display of related activities
 * - Permission Management Integration - Permission detail view enhancement
 * - Authorization Workflow Context - Activities requiring permission for approval
 * 
 * **Architecture**: 
 * This view cell extends CakePHP Cell to provide reusable permission-activity
 * relationship display functionality that can be embedded in permission detail
 * views, administrative interfaces, and authorization workflow documentation.
 * 
 * **Permission Integration Context**:
 * - **Permission Detail Views**: Shows activities that grant specific permission
 * - **Authorization Workflow**: Displays activities requiring permission for approval
 * - **Administrative Interface**: Permission-activity relationship management
 * - **Documentation**: Permission scope and impact visualization
 * 
 * **Activity Discovery Logic**:
 * - Queries activities table for specified permission ID
 * - Includes activity group information for hierarchical display
 * - Provides comprehensive activity configuration details
 * - Shows complete permission-activity relationship scope
 * 
 * **Display Organization**:
 * - Activities grouped by activity group for clarity
 * - Hierarchical display for administrative navigation
 * - Activity configuration details for authorization context
 * - Permission scope visualization for impact assessment
 * 
 * **Use Cases**:
 * - **Permission Management**: Understanding permission scope and impact
 * - **Authorization Workflow**: Identifying activities requiring permission
 * - **Administrative Oversight**: Permission-activity relationship validation
 * - **Documentation**: Permission system scope visualization
 * 
 * **Integration Points**:
 * - ActivitiesTable - Activity configuration and permission relationships
 * - ActivityGroupsTable - Hierarchical organization and display
 * - Permission Management - Permission detail view integration
 * - Authorization System - Approval authority visualization
 * 
 * **Performance Considerations**:
 * - Single query for activity discovery
 * - Efficient activity group loading
 * - Minimal association overhead
 * - Optimized for permission detail views
 * 
 * **Usage Examples**:
 * 
 * ```php
 * // Permission detail view integration
 * echo $this->cell('Activities.PermissionActivities', [$permission->id]);
 * 
 * // Administrative permission management
 * echo $this->cell('Activities.PermissionActivities', [$permissionId]);
 * 
 * // Authorization workflow documentation
 * echo $this->cell('Activities.PermissionActivities', [$permission->id]);
 * ```
 * 
 * **Template Integration**:
 * Provides activity listing with:
 * - Activity names and configuration details
 * - Activity group organization
 * - Permission relationship context
 * - Administrative action links
 * 
 * **Administrative Features**:
 * - Permission-activity relationship visualization
 * - Activity configuration review
 * - Authorization workflow documentation
 * - Permission scope impact assessment
 * 
 * **Security Considerations**:
 * - Permission-based access control
 * - Activity configuration visibility
 * - Administrative authorization requirements
 * - Permission relationship validation
 * 
 * **Error Handling**:
 * - Graceful handling of missing permission
 * - Empty activity list display
 * - Invalid permission ID protection
 * - Association loading error recovery
 * 
 * **Troubleshooting**:
 * - Verify permission exists and is valid
 * - Check activity-permission relationship configuration
 * - Validate activity group associations
 * - Monitor query performance for large activity sets

     * 
     * **Activity Discovery**:
     * - Queries activities table for specified permission ID
     * - Includes activity group information for hierarchical display
     * - Loads complete activity configuration for context
     * - Provides comprehensive permission-activity relationship data
     *

     * - Hierarchical structure for administrative display
     * - Complete activity configuration details
     * - Permission relationship context

     * **Authorization Context**:
     * Shows activities that:
     * - Grant the specified permission upon authorization
     * - Require the permission for approval authority
     * - Are part of permission-based authorization workflows
     * - Demonstrate permission scope and impact
     * 
     * **Template Data**:
     * Sets activities variable containing:
     * - Activity entities with full configuration
     * - Associated activity group information
     * - Permission relationship details
     * - Administrative context for management
     * 
     * **Performance Features**:
     * - Single efficient query for activity discovery
     * - Optimized association loading
     * - Minimal data transfer for display
     * - Cached query results where applicable
