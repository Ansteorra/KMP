# Waiver Secretary Dashboard - Implementation Summary

## Overview

A comprehensive dashboard has been created for the Waiver Secretary role to manage waiver compliance across all gatherings. The dashboard provides key metrics, search functionality, and administrative oversight tools.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Dashboard Action (`GatheringWaiversController::dashboard()`)

**Location**: `/workspaces/KMP/app/plugins/Waivers/src/Controller/GatheringWaiversController.php`

The dashboard action provides:
- **Authorization**: Branch-scoped access based on user permissions
- **Key Statistics**: Totals, recent uploads, declined waivers, compliance counts
- **Search Functionality**: Search across gatherings, branches, members, and waiver types
- **Compliance Tracking**: Identifies gatherings missing waivers
- **Branch Analysis**: Shows which branches have the most compliance issues
- **Activity Monitoring**: Recent waiver uploads and changes
- **Waiver Type Summary**: Counts by waiver type

### 2. Dashboard Template

**Location**: `/workspaces/KMP/app/plugins/Waivers/templates/GatheringWaivers/dashboard.php`

The template includes:

#### Search Bar
- Full-text search across gatherings, branches, members, and waiver types
- Results show gathering name, branch, waiver type, uploader, and date
- Direct link to view individual waivers

#### Key Statistics Cards
- **Total Waivers**: All-time count of uploaded waivers
- **Last 30 Days**: Recent waiver uploads
- **Missing Waivers**: Gatherings currently missing required waivers
- **Declined Waivers**: Count of rejected waiver uploads
- **Active Branches**: Branches with recent gathering activity

#### Gatherings Missing Waivers (Next 30 Days)
- Shows upcoming gatherings that need waivers
- Displays gathering name, branch, dates, days until start
- Lists specific missing waiver types
- Urgent warnings for events starting within 7 days
- Quick links to upload waivers or view gathering details

#### Branches with Compliance Issues
- Top 10 branches ranked by number of gatherings missing waivers
- Shows gathering count and total missing waivers per branch
- Links to branch details

#### Recent Waiver Activity (Last 30 Days)
- Table of the 20 most recent waiver uploads
- Shows date, gathering, branch, waiver type, and uploader
- Helps track compliance progress

#### Waiver Types Summary
- List of all active waiver types
- Count of waivers uploaded for each type
- Helps identify which waiver types are most commonly used

#### Quick Actions
- "View Gatherings Needing Waivers" - Link to detailed view
- "Manage Waiver Types" - Configure waiver types
- "Upload Waiver" - Direct upload access
- "All Waivers" - Browse all waivers

### 3. Authorization Policy

**Location**: `/workspaces/KMP/app/plugins/Waivers/src/Policy/GatheringWaiversControllerPolicy.php`

Added `canDashboard()` method to authorize access to the dashboard action. This integrates with KMP's RBAC system to ensure only authorized users can access the dashboard.

### 4. Navigation Integration

**Location**: `/workspaces/KMP/app/plugins/Waivers/src/Services/WaiversNavigationProvider.php`

Added "Waiver Dashboard" navigation item:
- Appears under the "Waivers" section in the main menu
- Order: 5 (appears before other waiver menu items)
- Icon: `bi-speedometer2` (speedometer icon)
- Only visible to logged-in users
- Active when viewing the dashboard

## URL Access

The dashboard is accessible at:
```
/waivers/gathering-waivers/dashboard
```

## Permissions

Access is controlled by:
- User must be logged in
- User must have permission to upload waivers for at least one branch
- If user has no branch permissions, they are redirected with an error message

## Data Scope

The dashboard respects branch-based permissions:
- **Global Permission** (null): Shows data for all branches
- **Branch-Specific**: Shows only data for assigned branches
- **No Permission**: Shows error and redirects

## Helper Methods

The following private methods support the dashboard:

1. `_searchWaivers()` - Search functionality across multiple fields
2. `_getDashboardStatistics()` - Calculate key metrics
3. `_getGatheringsMissingWaivers()` - Find gatherings missing required waivers
4. `_getBranchesWithIssues()` - Aggregate compliance issues by branch
5. `_getRecentWaiverActivity()` - Retrieve recent uploads
6. `_getWaiverTypesSummary()` - Count waivers by type

## Technical Details

### Database Queries
- Uses branch-scoped queries for all data
- Excludes soft-deleted records (`deleted IS null`)
- Excludes declined waivers from compliance counts
- Optimized with selective field loading using `contain()`

### Performance Considerations
- Search results limited to 50 records
- Recent activity limited to 20 records
- Branches with issues limited to top 10
- Uses date range filters to limit query scope

### Dependencies
- `Cake\I18n\Date` for date manipulation
- Branch permission system (`getBranchIdsForAction()`)
- Multiple table associations (Gatherings, Branches, WaiverTypes, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Export Functionality**: CSV/PDF export of dashboard data
2. **Date Range Filters**: Allow custom date ranges for statistics
3. **Email Notifications**: Alert branch officers about missing waivers
4. **Trend Analysis**: Charts showing waiver compliance over time
5. **Batch Operations**: Upload multiple waivers at once
6. **Retention Policy Alerts**: Show waivers approaching retention deadline
7. **Compliance Reports**: Generate formal compliance reports by branch/date

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with different permission levels (global, branch-specific, no access)
2. Verify search functionality across all searchable fields
3. Test with gatherings at various stages (upcoming, ongoing, ended)
4. Verify statistics calculations with known data
5. Test performance with large datasets
6. Verify navigation integration and active state
7. Test responsive design on mobile devices

## Usage Guide
