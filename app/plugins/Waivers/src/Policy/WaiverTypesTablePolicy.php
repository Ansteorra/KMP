/**
 * WaiverTypes Table Authorization Policy - Bulk Operations and Query Scoping
 * 
 * The WaiverTypesTablePolicy class provides table-level authorization for WaiverTypes
 * data operations, implementing query scoping and bulk operation authorization based
 * on user permissions. This policy ensures that waiver type management operations
 * are properly authorized and scoped to the user's organizational context.
 * 
 * ## Table-Level Authorization Architecture
 * 
 * The WaiverTypesTablePolicy implements standard table authorization patterns:
 * - **Query Scoping**: WaiverTypes queries filtered based on user permissions
 * - **Branch Integration**: Access controlled through branch-based scoping and hierarchy
 * - **Permission Integration**: Seamless integration with PermissionsLoader and warrant-based authorization
 * - **Administrative Override**: Global permissions bypass branch restrictions for admin operations
 * 
 * ## Query Scoping Implementation
 * 
 * ### Branch-Based Data Access
 * The policy implements branch scoping for organizational data isolation:
 * - **Branch Discovery**: User branch permissions resolved through _getBranchIdsForPolicy()
 * - **Query Filtering**: WaiverTypes queries automatically scoped to authorized branch contexts
 * - **Hierarchical Access**: Parent-child branch relationships supported for organizational management
 * - **Administrative Override**: Global permissions bypass branch restrictions
 * 
 * ## Bulk Operations Authorization
 * 
 * ### Table Query Authorization
 * The policy inherits standard table operations through BasePolicy:
 * - **Index Operations**: WaiverTypes listing authorized through canIndex() delegation
 * - **Export Authorization**: WaiverTypes export operations controlled through permissions
 * - **Bulk Updates**: Mass operations authorized through individual entity permission checking
 * - **Administrative Operations**: Bulk administrative operations with appropriate validation
 * 
 * ## Permission Integration Architecture
 * 
 * ### BasePolicy Delegation
 * Standard authorization operations delegated to BasePolicy framework:
 * - **Permission Discovery**: WaiverTypes permissions resolved through PermissionsLoader
 * - **Warrant Validation**: Table operations authorized through warrant-based authority checking
 * - **Branch Scoping**: Organizational access control through branch-based permission validation
 * - **Administrative Authority**: Super user and administrative permissions for system management
 * 
 * ## Security Implementation
 * 
 * ### Query Security
 * Comprehensive query-level security implementation:
 * - **Injection Prevention**: Query scoping through parameterized queries and ORM integration
 * - **Access Validation**: All query operations validated against user permissions
 * - **Data Filtering**: Data automatically filtered to prevent unauthorized access
 * - **Audit Integration**: Query operations logged for compliance monitoring
 * 
 * ### Performance Security
 * Security implementation optimized for performance:
 * - **Efficient Scoping**: Query scoping at database level for optimal performance
 * - **Permission Caching**: User permissions cached to reduce authorization overhead
 * - **Index Optimization**: Query scoping designed to utilize database indexes
 * - **Scalability**: Authorization system designed to scale with organizational growth
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ### Controller Integration
 * ```php
 * // WaiverTypesController index with automatic query scoping
 * public function index() {
 *     $query = $this->WaiverTypes->find();
 *     $query = $this->Authorization->applyScope($query);
 *     $waiverTypes = $this->paginate($query);
 *     $this->set(compact('waiverTypes'));
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Service Layer Integration
 * ```php
 * // Waiver type discovery service with policy scoping
 * public function getActiveWaiverTypes() {
 *     $query = $this->WaiverTypes->find('active');
 *     $query = $this->Authorization->applyScope($query);
 *     return $query->toArray();
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Integration Points
 * 
 * ### BasePolicy Integration
 * - **Standard Operations**: Inherits canAdd(), canEdit(), canDelete(), canView() through delegation
 * - **Permission Framework**: Seamless integration with RBAC through BasePolicy inheritance
 * - **Branch Scoping**: Organizational access control through branch-based validation
 * - **Administrative Authority**: Super user and administrative permissions for system management
 * 
 * ### PermissionsLoader Integration
 * - **Permission Discovery**: WaiverTypes permissions resolved through centralized loading
 * - **Warrant Integration**: Table operations authorized through warrant-based authority validation
 * - **Branch Authorization**: Multi-branch permission resolution for complex structures
 * - **Caching Support**: Permission data cached for improved authorization performance
 * 
 * ## Security Considerations
 * 
 * ### Data Protection
 * - **Branch Isolation**: Data access limited to authorized organizational contexts
 * - **Permission Validation**: All table operations validated against RBAC permissions
 * - **Query Security**: Queries protected against injection and unauthorized access
 * - **Audit Trail**: Table operations logged for compliance monitoring
 * 
 * ### Access Control
 * - **Authentication Required**: All table operations require authenticated user identity
 * - **Authorization Validation**: Table access controlled through permission checking
 * - **Organizational Security**: Multi-branch access control ensures data isolation
 * - **Administrative Oversight**: Administrative access supports system management
