/**
 * Officers Plugin Departments Management Controller
 * 
 * This controller provides comprehensive department management functionality within
 * the Officers plugin, handling the complete CRUD lifecycle for organizational
 * departments. It manages departmental structure, administrative interfaces, and
 * hierarchical organization while integrating with the Officers plugin security
 * framework and organizational management system.
 * 
 * ## Core Responsibilities
 * 
 * ### 1. Department CRUD Operations
 * - **Index**: Paginated department listing with hierarchical ordering
 * - **View**: Comprehensive department detail display with associated offices
 * - **Add**: Department creation with validation and workflow integration
 * - **Edit**: Department modification with authorization and data integrity
 * - **Delete**: Soft deletion with referential integrity protection
 * 
 * ### 2. Organizational Structure Management
 * - Manages departmental categorization and organizational hierarchy
 * - Integrates with office management for complete organizational structure
 * - Provides administrative interface for department configuration
 * - Supports hierarchical navigation and reporting
 * 
 * ### 3. Security & Authorization Integration
 * - Inherits Officers plugin security baseline from AppController
 * - Implements model-level authorization for department operations
 * - Provides entity-level authorization for individual departments
 * - Integrates with RBAC system for permission-based access control
 * 
 * ### 4. Administrative Interface & Workflow
 * - Provides user-friendly interfaces for department management
 * - Integrates Flash messaging for user feedback
 * - Supports navigation history and breadcrumb management
 * - Implements error handling and validation feedback
 * 
 * ## Authorization Architecture
 * 
 * The controller implements a layered authorization approach:
 * 
 * ### Model-Level Authorization
 * ```php
 * $this->Authorization->authorizeModel("index", "add");
 * ```
 * - Authorizes table-level operations (index, add) via DepartmentsTablePolicy
 * - Provides bulk operation permissions and administrative access control
 * 
 * ### Entity-Level Authorization
 * ```php
 * $this->Authorization->authorize($department);
 * ```
 * - Authorizes individual department operations via DepartmentPolicy
 * - Provides fine-grained access control for specific departments
 * 
 * ## Data Management Patterns
 * 
 * ### Association Loading
 * - **View**: Loads Offices with role and deputy relationships for complete context
 * - **Edit**: Minimal loading for performance optimization
 * - **Index**: Basic department data for listing efficiency
 * 
 * ### Validation & Error Handling
 * - Comprehensive validation through DepartmentsTable
 * - Flash messaging for user feedback on success/failure
 * - Exception handling for missing records
 * - Referential integrity protection in deletion
 * 
 * ## Integration Points
 * 
 * This controller integrates with several Officers plugin subsystems:
 * - **DepartmentsTable**: Core data management and validation
 * - **OfficesTable**: Associated office management and hierarchy
 * - **Authorization Framework**: Policy-based access control
 * - **Flash Component**: Standardized user feedback
 * - **Navigation System**: Breadcrumb and history management
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ### Basic Department Listing
 * ```php
 * // GET /officers/departments
 * // Displays paginated department list with alphabetical ordering
 * // Requires "index" permission via DepartmentsTablePolicy
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Department Detail View
 * ```php
 * // GET /officers/departments/view/1
 * // Shows department with associated offices, roles, and deputy relationships
 * // Requires entity-level authorization via DepartmentPolicy
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Department Creation Workflow
 * ```php
 * // GET /officers/departments/add - Show form
 * // POST /officers/departments/add - Process creation
 * // Redirects to view on success, shows form with errors on failure
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Administrative Operations
 * ```php
 * // Soft deletion preserves referential integrity
 * // Edit operations maintain audit trail
 * // Authorization ensures administrative access
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Security Considerations
 * 
 * - **Plugin Validation**: Inherits Officers plugin enablement checking
 * - **Authentication**: Requires valid user identity for all operations
 * - **Authorization**: Multi-level permission checking (model + entity)
 * - **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation via DepartmentsTable
 * - **Soft Deletion**: Preserves data integrity and audit trail
 * - **Exception Handling**: Secure error handling with appropriate HTTP codes
 * 
 * ## Performance Optimization
 * 
 * - **Selective Loading**: Optimized association loading per operation
 * - **Pagination**: Efficient large dataset handling
 * - **Query Optimization**: Alphabetical ordering for user experience
 * - **Minimal Edit Loading**: Performance optimization for edit operations

    /**
     * Initialize controller with authorization configuration
     * 
     * Establishes the security framework and authorization patterns for all
     * department management operations. This method configures model-level
     * authorization and inherits the complete Officers plugin security baseline.
     * 
     * ## Authorization Configuration
     * 
     * ### Model-Level Authorization
     * Authorizes table-level operations through DepartmentsTablePolicy:
     * - **index**: Department listing and pagination access
     * - **add**: Department creation permissions
     * 
     * ### Entity-Level Authorization
     * Individual department operations are authorized in each action method
     * through DepartmentPolicy for fine-grained access control.
     * 
     * ## Inherited Security Framework
     * 
     * From AppController, this method provides:
     * - Complete KMP authentication and authorization framework
     * - Officers plugin security baseline and component configuration
     * - Flash messaging for standardized user feedback
     * - Navigation history and breadcrumb management
     * - Plugin validation ensuring Officers plugin is enabled
     * 
     * ## Security Architecture
     * 
     * The authorization strategy follows this pattern:
     * 1. **Plugin Validation**: Officers plugin must be enabled
     * 2. **Authentication**: Valid user identity required
     * 3. **Model Authorization**: Table-level permissions via DepartmentsTablePolicy
     * 4. **Entity Authorization**: Individual department permissions via DepartmentPolicy
     * 5. **RBAC Integration**: Role-based access control for administrative operations
     * 
     * ## Component Integration
     * 
     * Inherited components from AppController:
     * - **Authentication**: User identity management
     * - **Authorization**: Permission checking with policy integration
     * - **Flash**: Standardized user feedback messaging

     * Department deletion with soft deletion and referential integrity
     * 
     * Handles department deletion with comprehensive safety measures including
     * soft deletion, referential integrity protection, and audit trail
     * maintenance. This method ensures safe removal of departments while
     * preserving organizational data integrity.
     * 
     * ## Features
     * 
     * ### Soft Deletion Pattern
     * - Marks department as deleted rather than hard deletion
     * - Preserves referential integrity with associated offices
     * - Maintains audit trail and historical data
     * - Prefixes name with "Deleted:" for identification
     * 
     * ### Security & Authorization
     * - Restricts deletion to POST/DELETE methods for CSRF protection
     * - Validates department exists before processing
     * - Authorizes deletion permissions via DepartmentPolicy
     * - Ensures only authorized users can delete departments
     * 
     * ### Referential Integrity Protection
     * - Preserves associated office relationships
     * - Maintains organizational structure consistency
     * - Prevents data orphaning and relationship corruption
     * - Supports data recovery if needed
     * 
     * ### Administrative Workflow
     * - Clear user feedback on deletion success/failure
     * - Redirects to index for continued administration
     * - Integrates with Officers plugin workflow patterns
     * - Maintains navigation context and user expectations
     * 
     * ## Request Method Validation
     * 
     * Restricts to secure HTTP methods:
     * ```php
     * $this->request->allowMethod(['post', 'delete']);
     * ```
     * - Prevents accidental deletion via GET requests
     * - Provides CSRF protection for sensitive operations
     * - Follows security best practices for destructive operations
     * 
     * ## Soft Deletion Implementation
     * 
     * Modifies department name before deletion:
     * ```php
     * $department->name = "Deleted: " . $department->name;
     * ```
     * - Clearly identifies deleted departments
     * - Preserves original name for audit purposes
     * - Enables potential data recovery workflows
     * - Maintains referential integrity
     * 
     * ## Error Handling
     * 
     * - Validates department exists before processing
     * - Throws 404 NotFoundException for invalid department IDs
     * - Handles deletion failures gracefully with user feedback
     * - Provides clear error messaging for troubleshooting
     * 
     * ## User Feedback
     * 
     * Flash messaging provides deletion status:
     * - Success: "The department has been deleted."
     * - Error: "The department could not be deleted. Please, try again."
     * 
     * ## Business Rule Validation
     * 
     * The DepartmentsTable may implement additional business rules:
     * - Prevent deletion of departments with active offices
     * - Validate organizational structure constraints
     * - Enforce administrative approval requirements
     * - Maintain data integrity across the organization
     * 
     * @param string|null $id Department ID for deletion
     * @return \Cake\Http\Response|null Redirects to index after processing
     * @throws \Cake\Datasource\Exception\RecordNotFoundException When department not found
     * @throws \Cake\Http\Exception\NotFoundException When department doesn't exist
     * 
     * @see \Officers\Policy\DepartmentPolicy::canDelete() For authorization logic
     * @see \Officers\Model\Table\DepartmentsTable::delete() For deletion processing
     * @see \Officers\Model\Entity\Department For entity structure
     * 
     * @example Deletion Flow
     * ```php
     * // POST/DELETE /officers/departments/delete/1
     * // 1. Validate HTTP method
     * // 2. Load and authorize department
     * // 3. Mark as deleted and save
     * // 4. Redirect to index with feedback
     * ```
     * 
     * @example Template Integration
     * ```php
     * // In templates/Departments/view.php
     * echo $this->Form->postLink(
     *     'Delete Department',
     *     ['action' => 'delete', $department->id],
     *     ['confirm' => 'Are you sure you want to delete this department?']
     * );
     * ```
     * 
     * @example Business Rule Integration
     * ```php
     * // In DepartmentsTable::beforeDelete()
     * if (!empty($entity->offices)) {
     *     throw new \RuntimeException('Cannot delete department with active offices');
     * }
     * ```
     */
    public function delete($id = null)

        $this->request->allowMethod(['post', 'delete']);

        // Load department for deletion
        $department = $this->Departments->get($id);

        // Validate department exists
        if (!$department) {

        // Implement soft deletion pattern
        // Mark department as deleted while preserving referential integrity
        $department->name = "Deleted: " . $department->name;

        // Attempt deletion with comprehensive error handling
        if ($this->Departments->delete($department)) {
            $this->Flash->success(__('The department has been deleted.'));
        } else {
