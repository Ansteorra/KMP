/**
 * Officers Plugin Base Controller
 * 
 * This is the foundational controller for the Officers plugin, providing shared
 * functionality and security architecture for all officer management controllers.
 * It establishes the security baseline, component configuration, and architectural
 * integration patterns used throughout the Officers plugin.
 * 
 * ## Core Responsibilities
 * 
 * ### 1. Security Architecture Foundation
 * - Inherits complete KMP security framework from base AppController
 * - Provides Officers plugin-specific security baseline for all controllers
 * - Integrates with RBAC system for officer management permissions
 * - Establishes warrant validation patterns for officer operations
 * 
 * ### 2. Component Management
 * - Inherits Authentication/Authorization components from base controller
 * - Provides Flash messaging for officer workflow feedback
 * - Establishes consistent component loading patterns for plugin controllers
 * - Integrates with service container for Officers plugin services
 * 
 * ### 3. Plugin Integration Architecture
 * - Provides seamless integration with KMP application architecture
 * - Establishes officer-specific request processing patterns
 * - Integrates with officer management services and business logic
 * - Provides foundation for hierarchical permission checking
 * 
 * ## Inherited Security Features
 * 
 * From base AppController, this controller provides:
 * - **Plugin Validation**: Ensures Officers plugin is enabled before processing
 * - **Request Detection**: CSV export support and Turbo Frame integration
 * - **Navigation History**: Maintains breadcrumb context for officer workflows
 * - **View Cell Integration**: Supports dynamic UI components from Officers plugin
 * - **Authentication/Authorization**: Complete user security framework
 * 
 * ## Officers Plugin Security Baseline
 * 
 * All Officers controllers inherit this security configuration:
 * ```php
 * class DepartmentsController extends AppController
 * {
 *     public function initialize(): void
 *     {
 *         parent::initialize(); // Inherits Officers security baseline
 *         // Controller-specific authorization configuration
 *         $this->Authorization->authorizeModel('index', 'add');
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Integration Points
 * 
 * This controller integrates with several Officers plugin subsystems:
 * - **Officer Management**: Via OfficerManagerInterface service
 * - **Warrant System**: Via warrant validation and lifecycle management
 * - **Hierarchical Organization**: Via department/office relationship management
 * - **Assignment Processing**: Via ActiveWindow behavior and temporal validation
 * - **Navigation**: Via OfficersNavigationProvider service
 * - **View Components**: Via OfficersViewCellProvider service
 * 
 * ## Component Architecture
 * 
 * The component loading strategy follows this pattern:
 * 1. **Authentication**: User identity management and login/logout
 * 2. **Authorization**: Permission checking with Officers plugin policies
 * 3. **Flash**: Standardized user feedback across officer workflows
 * 4. **Service Integration**: Access to Officers plugin business logic services
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ### Basic Controller Extension
 * ```php
 * namespace Officers\Controller;
 * 
 * class DepartmentsController extends AppController
 * {
 *     public function index()
 *     {
 *         // Inherits security baseline, navigation, flash messaging
 *         $departments = $this->paginate($this->Departments);
 *         $this->set(compact('departments'));
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Officer Workflow Integration
 * ```php
 * public function assign()
 * {
 *     // Flash messaging inherited from base
 *     $this->Flash->success('Officer assigned successfully');
 *     
 *     // Navigation history maintained automatically
 *     $this->redirect($this->referer());
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Component Customization
 * ```php
 * public function initialize(): void
 * {
 *     parent::initialize(); // Officers security baseline
 *     
 *     // Add controller-specific components
 *     $this->loadComponent('Paginator');
 *     $this->loadComponent('RequestHandler');
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Security Considerations
 * 
 * - **Plugin Security**: Validates Officers plugin is enabled before processing
 * - **Authentication**: Requires valid user identity for all operations
 * - **Authorization**: Integrates with Officers plugin policy classes
 * - **Warrant Validation**: Supports warrant-based operation authorization
 * - **Branch Scoping**: Supports hierarchical data access patterns
 * - **Audit Integration**: Provides foundation for officer operation audit trails
 * 
 * ## Performance Optimization
 * 
 * - **Component Reuse**: Efficient component loading and initialization
 * - **Service Integration**: Lazy loading of Officers plugin services
 * - **Navigation Efficiency**: Optimized page stack management
 * - **View Cell Caching**: Supports plugin view cell performance optimization

    /**
     * Initialize controller with Officers plugin configuration
     * 
     * This method establishes the security baseline and component configuration
     * for all Officers plugin controllers. It inherits the complete KMP security
     * framework from the base AppController while providing Officers-specific
     * integration patterns.
     * 
     * ## Inherited Components (from Base AppController)
     * - **Authentication**: User identity management and session handling
     * - **Authorization**: Permission checking with policy integration
     * - **Flash**: Standardized user feedback messaging
     * 
     * ## Component Loading Strategy
     * 1. Call parent initialization for complete KMP security framework
     * 2. Officers plugin security baseline established through inheritance
     * 3. Service container integration available for Officers plugin services
     * 4. Plugin validation ensures Officers plugin is enabled
     * 
     * ## Security Configuration
     * The inherited security framework provides:
     * - Plugin access validation (Officers plugin must be enabled)
     * - User authentication requirement for all operations
     * - Authorization policy integration for officer operations
     * - RBAC integration for hierarchical permission checking
     * - Warrant validation support for officer assignment operations
     * 
     * ## Service Integration
     * Officers plugin services are available through dependency injection:
     * ```php
     * // Service container access pattern (available after parent initialization)
     * $officerManager = $this->getContainer()->get(OfficerManagerInterface::class);
     * $warrantManager = $this->getContainer()->get(WarrantManagerInterface::class);
     * ```
     * 
     * ## Usage in Child Controllers
     * ```php
     * class DepartmentsController extends AppController
     * {
     *     public function initialize(): void
     *     {
     *         parent::initialize(); // Officers security baseline
     *         
     *         // Add controller-specific authorization
     *         $this->Authorization->authorizeModel('index', 'add');
     *         
     *         // Load additional components if needed
     *         $this->loadComponent('Paginator');
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * @return void
     * 
     * @see \App\Controller\AppController::initialize() For inherited component loading
     * @see \Officers\Services\OfficerManagerInterface For officer business logic
     * @see \Officers\Policy\* For Officers plugin authorization policies
