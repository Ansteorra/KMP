/**
 * Officers Controller - Comprehensive Officer Lifecycle Management
 * 
 * This controller manages the complete lifecycle of officer assignments within the KMP organization,
 * providing sophisticated functionality for assignment creation, modification, release processing,
 * warrant integration, and comprehensive reporting. The controller serves as the primary interface
 * for officer management workflows, integrating deeply with the warrant system, role management,
 * and temporal validation frameworks.
 * 
 * ## Core Responsibilities
 * 
 * ### Officer Assignment Management
 * - **Assignment Processing**: Complete officer assignment workflows with comprehensive validation
 * - **Temporal Management**: Integration with ActiveWindow behavior for assignment lifecycle
 * - **Warrant Integration**: Automatic warrant request generation and status tracking
 * - **Role Assignment**: Integration with RBAC system for automatic role grants
 * - **Deputy Management**: Support for deputy assignments with descriptive metadata
 * 
 * ### Officer Lifecycle Operations
 * - **Assignment Creation**: Multi-step assignment process with validation and approval
 * - **Assignment Modification**: In-place editing of officer assignments and metadata
 * - **Assignment Release**: Controlled release process with audit trail and reason tracking
 * - **Status Management**: Real-time status tracking with automated status updates
 * - **Expiration Handling**: Automatic processing of expired assignments
 * 
 * ### Warrant System Integration
 * - **Automatic Warrant Requests**: Integration with WarrantManager for role validation
 * - **Manual Warrant Processing**: Administrative warrant request capabilities
 * - **Status Synchronization**: Real-time warrant status integration
 * - **Compliance Tracking**: Warrant requirement validation and enforcement
 *

 * - **Operation-Specific Permissions**: Granular permission checking for officer operations
 * - **Branch-Scoped Access**: Permission-based filtering for organizational data access
 * 
 * ### Database Transaction Management
 * - **Assignment Transactions**: Multi-table updates with rollback capabilities
 * - **Warrant Coordination**: Coordinated updates across officer and warrant systems
 * - **Audit Trail Integration**: Comprehensive logging of all officer operations
 * 
 * ## Workflow Integration
 * 
 * ### Assignment Workflow

 * 2. **Business Logic Validation**: Validate assignment rules and constraints
 * 3. **Officer Creation**: Create officer record with temporal validation
 * 4. **Role Assignment**: Automatic role grants through warrant integration
 * 5. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail creation
 * 
 * ### Release Workflow

 * 2. **Status Validation**: Ensure officer is in releasable state
 * 3. **Release Processing**: Update officer status and expiration
 * 4. **Warrant Revocation**: Coordinate warrant system updates
 * 5. **Audit Trail**: Complete release audit logging
 * 
 * ## Performance Considerations
 * 
 * ### Query Optimization

 * - **Index Utilization**: Database index optimization for common query patterns
 * - **Pagination Support**: Efficient pagination for large officer datasets
 * - **Search Optimization**: Optimized search with special character handling
 * 
 * ### Caching Strategy
 * - **Permission Caching**: Cached permission results for performance
 * - **Status Caching**: Cached warrant status for real-time display
 * - **Autocomplete Caching**: Optimized member search with result caching
 * 
 * ## Security Architecture
 * 
 * ### Data Protection
 * - **Authorization Enforcement**: Comprehensive authorization checking
 * - **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all user inputs
 * - **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM protection
 * - **Privacy Protection**: Member data privacy in search and autocomplete
 * 
 * ### Audit & Compliance

    /**
     * Officer Data Export API
     * 
     * Provides CSV export functionality for officer assignment data with flexible
     * filtering capabilities and comprehensive data formatting. This method generates
     * downloadable CSV files for administrative reporting, data analysis, and
     * external system integration.
     * 
     * ## Export Features
     * 
     * ### CSV Format
     * - **Standard CSV**: RFC 4180 compliant CSV format
     * - **UTF-8 Encoding**: Unicode support for international characters
     * - **Header Row**: Descriptive column headers for data interpretation
     * - **Downloadable**: Automatic download with timestamped filename
     * 
     * ### Filtering Capabilities
     * - **Status Filter**: Filter by officer assignment status
     * - **Expiration Filter**: Filter by assignment expiration timeframe
     * - **Flexible Criteria**: Combinable filter parameters for precise data selection
     * 
     * ### Data Columns
     * - **Office Information**: Office name with deputy description integration
     * - **Member Details**: Member SCA name using privacy-safe data methods
     * - **Contact Information**: Officer email address for communication
     * - **Organizational Context**: Branch and department information
     * - **Temporal Data**: Assignment start and end dates with formatting
     * 
     * ## Authorization Architecture
     * 
     * ### Public API Access
     * - **Unauthenticated Access**: Configured in initialize() for API access
     * - **Export Permissions**: Administrative export capabilities
     * - **Data Security**: Privacy-aware data export using publicData() methods
     * 
     * ### Privacy Protection
     * - **Public Data Methods**: Use of Member::publicData() for privacy compliance
     * - **Data Minimization**: Only essential officer data in export
     * - **Administrative Context**: Export designed for administrative use
     * 
     * ## Query Construction
     * 
     * ### Base Query
     * - **Association Loading**: Comprehensive association loading for export data
     * - **Status Filtering**: Optional status-based filtering
     * - **Date Filtering**: Optional expiration date range filtering
     * 
     * ### Filter Parameters
     * - **Status Parameter**: `status` query parameter for assignment status filtering
     * - **Expiration Parameter**: `endsIn` query parameter for days-ahead filtering
     * - **Combinable Filters**: Multiple filter parameters supported simultaneously
     * 
     * ## Data Processing
     * 
     * ### Deputy Integration
     * - **Office Name Enhancement**: Deputy description integration with office names
     * - **Conditional Formatting**: Deputy description added when present
     * - **Administrative Context**: Complete office identification for export
     * 
     * ### Date Formatting
     * - **Internationalization**: i18nFormat() for localized date formatting
     * - **Consistent Format**: MM-dd-yyyy format for administrative consistency
     * - **Null Handling**: Safe handling of null date values
     * 
     * ## Performance Considerations
     * 
     * ### Memory Management
     * - **Streaming Output**: Direct output streaming for large datasets
     * - **Memory Efficiency**: Efficient CSV generation without memory buffering
     * - **Resource Management**: Proper resource cleanup for file operations
     * 
     * ### Export Optimization
     * - **Query Efficiency**: Optimized query for export performance
     * - **Association Strategy**: Strategic association loading for export needs
     *
