/**
 * Departments Table - Departmental data management and organizational structure
 *
 * The DepartmentsTable provides comprehensive data management operations for the
 * organizational department structure within the Officers plugin. It handles
 * departmental categorization, office relationships, and administrative access
 * control with integration into the broader KMP authorization system.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 * - **Categorical Organization**: Manages departmental groupings for offices
 * - **Administrative Management**: Provides CRUD operations with validation
 * - **Extensibility Design**: Built on BaseTable for consistent behavior patterns
 * - **Access Control**: Permission-based department visibility management
 * - **Hierarchical Organization**: Supports office containment within departments
 * - **Data Integrity**: Validation framework with uniqueness constraints
 * - **Audit Trail**: Automatic timestamp and footprint tracking
 *
 * ## Database Structure
 * - **Table**: `officers_departments`
 * - **Primary Key**: `id` (auto-increment)
 * - **Display Field**: `name` (human-readable identifier)
 * - **Unique Constraint**: Department names must be unique
 * - **Soft Deletion**: Supports archival through `deleted` timestamp
 *
 * ## Association Architecture
 * - **hasMany Offices**: One-to-many relationship with office positions
 * - **Hierarchical Organization**: Departments contain multiple offices
 * - **Cross-Reference Support**: Offices can reference their parent department
 *
 * ## Behavior Integration
 * - **Timestamp**: Automatic created/modified timestamp management
 * - **Footprint**: User tracking for created_by/modified_by fields
 * - **BaseTable**: Inherits standard KMP table functionality
 *
 * ## Validation Framework
 * The table implements comprehensive validation including:
 * - Name field validation with length constraints and uniqueness
 * - Data integrity validation with required field enforcement
 * - Database-level rule checking for referential integrity
 * - Soft deletion date validation
 *
 * ## Administrative Features
 * - **Permission-Based Access**: Departments visible based on user permissions
 * - **Member Scope Filtering**: Shows only departments where user has officer roles
 * - **Super User Override**: Administrative users can see all departments
 * - **Empty State Handling**: Graceful handling of unauthorized access
 *
 * ## Usage Patterns
 * ```php
 * // Standard department operations
 * $departmentsTable = TableRegistry::getTableLocator()->get('Officers.Departments');
 * 
 * // Get departments user can work with
 * $accessibleDepts = $departmentsTable->departmentsMemberCanWork($user);
 * 
 * // Create new department with validation
 * $department = $departmentsTable->newEntity(['name' => 'Operations']);
 * $departmentsTable->save($department);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Integration Points
 * - **Office Management**: Direct relationship with OfficesTable
 * - **Domain System**: Integration with operational domain structure
 * - **Reporting System**: Departmental analytics and organizational reporting
 * - **Administrative Interfaces**: Form options and permission-based display
 * - **Authorization Framework**: Permission-based access control integration

    /**
     * Initialize table configuration and associations
     *
     * Configures the departments table with proper display settings, primary key
     * definition, and establishes associations with the Offices table. This method
     * sets up the foundational table behavior required for departmental data
     * management within the Officers plugin architecture.
     *
     * ## Configuration Setup
     * - **Table Name**: `officers_departments` (plugin-specific namespace)
     * - **Display Field**: `name` for human-readable identification
     * - **Primary Key**: `id` (standard auto-increment identifier)
     *
     * ## Association Configuration
     * The method establishes a hasMany relationship with the Offices table,
     * creating a one-to-many relationship where departments can contain
     * multiple office positions.
     *
     * ### Office Association Details
     * - **Type**: hasMany relationship
     * - **Target**: `Officers.Offices` table
     * - **Foreign Key**: `department_id` (references this table's primary key)
     * - **Dependent**: Offices are not automatically deleted with department
     * - **Cascade**: Manual cascade handling for organizational integrity
     *
     * ## Usage Context
     * This initialization supports:
     * - Departmental office listing and management
     * - Administrative form population with department options
     * - Hierarchical organizational structure queries
     * - Permission-based department filtering operations

    /**
     * Configure default validation rules for department entities
     *
     * Establishes comprehensive validation constraints for department data to ensure
     * organizational integrity and data quality. This method defines validation rules
     * for all department fields, focusing on required field enforcement, data type
     * validation, and business rule compliance.
     *
     * ## Name Field Validation
     * The department name field receives comprehensive validation to ensure
     * organizational clarity and prevent naming conflicts:
     * - **Data Type**: String scalar validation
     * - **Length Constraint**: Maximum 255 characters
     * - **Required Field**: Mandatory for create operations
     * - **Empty Check**: Cannot be empty or whitespace-only
     * - **Uniqueness**: Database-level unique constraint validation
     *
     * ## Soft Deletion Support
     * The validation includes support for soft deletion through the `deleted` field:
     * - **Data Type**: Date field validation
     * - **Optional Field**: Allows empty values for active departments
     * - **Business Logic**: Supports archival workflow without data loss
     *
     * ## Validation Architecture
     * - **Layered Validation**: Multiple validation types for comprehensive checking
     * - **Provider Integration**: Uses table provider for unique constraint checking
     * - **Error Handling**: Detailed validation messages for user feedback

     * at the database layer to provide additional validation enforcement during
     * save operations and prevent data inconsistencies.
     *
     * ## Uniqueness Constraints
     * The method enforces department name uniqueness at the database level:
     * - **Unique Name Rule**: Prevents duplicate department names
     * - **Error Field Assignment**: Associates validation errors with the name field
     * - **Database Enforcement**: Leverages database constraints for integrity
     * - **User Feedback**: Provides clear error messaging for constraint violations
     *
     * ## Rule Architecture
     * - **Layered Validation**: Works alongside field validation for comprehensive checking
     * - **Database Integration**: Utilizes database constraints for enforcement
     * - **Error Handling**: Proper error field mapping for user interface integration
     * - **Business Logic**: Enforces organizational naming conventions
     *
     * ## Enforcement Context
     * These rules apply during:
     * - Department creation operations (insert)
     * - Department modification operations (update)
     * - Bulk data operations and imports
     * - API-driven department management

    /**
     * Retrieve departments accessible to a specific user based on permissions and officer assignments
     *
     * Implements permission-based filtering to return only departments where the user
     * has legitimate access based on their authorization level and current officer
     * assignments. This method provides fine-grained access control for departmental
     * data while supporting both administrative oversight and role-based restrictions.
     *
     * ## Access Control Logic
     * The method implements a hierarchical permission system:
     * 1. **Super User Access**: Full access to all departments without restriction
     * 2. **Administrative Permissions**: Users with `seeAllDepartments` permission get full access
     * 3. **Officer-Based Access**: Standard users see only departments where they hold officer positions
     * 4. **Unauthorized Access**: Empty result set for users without valid permissions
     *
     * ## Permission Validation
     * - **User Authentication**: Validates user identity before processing
     * - **Super User Check**: Bypasses restrictions for administrative users
     * - **Permission Authorization**: Checks `seeAllDepartments` capability on empty entity
     * - **Graceful Degradation**: Returns empty array for invalid or unauthorized users
     *
     * ## Officer Assignment Resolution
     * For standard users, the method queries current officer assignments:
     * - **Current Officers Only**: Filters to active officer positions using CurrentOfficers finder
     * - **Department Resolution**: Follows officer → office → department association chain
     * - **Distinct Results**: Eliminates duplicate departments from multiple office assignments
     * - **Optimized Queries**: Uses strategic containment for efficient data retrieval
     *
     * ## Return Format
     * Returns associative array with department structure:
     * - **Key**: Department ID (for form option values)
     * - **Value**: Department name (for display purposes)
     * - **Order**: Alphabetical by department name
     * - **Format**: Ready for form select options and administrative interfaces
     *
     * ## Usage Examples
     * ```php
     * // Get departments for current user
     * $departments = $departmentsTable->departmentsMemberCanWork($currentUser);
     * 
     * // Use in form select options
     * echo $this->Form->select('department_id', $departments);
     * 
     * // Check if user has access to specific department
     * $hasAccess = array_key_exists($departmentId, $departments);
     * ```
     *
     * ## Performance Considerations
     * - **Efficient Queries**: Uses containment to minimize database queries
     * - **Selective Fields**: Retrieves only necessary fields for better performance
     * - **Result Caching**: Consider caching for frequently accessed user permissions
     * - **Index Optimization**: Relies on proper database indexing for officer queries
     *
     * ## Security Features
     * - **Authorization Integration**: Respects KMP permission system
     * - **Data Isolation**: Users only see departments relevant to their roles
     * - **Permission Validation**: Multiple layers of access control checking
     * - **Injection Prevention**: Uses proper ORM methods for SQL safety
