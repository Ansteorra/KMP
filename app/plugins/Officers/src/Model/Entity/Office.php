/**
 * Office Entity - Hierarchical office structure and warrant integration
 *
 * The Office entity represents individual officer positions within the organizational
 * hierarchy of the Officers plugin. Each office defines a specific role within a
 * department, with complex hierarchical relationships, warrant requirements, and
 * role assignments that integrate with the broader KMP authorization system.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 * - **Hierarchical Organization**: Deputy and reporting relationships between offices
 * - **Warrant Integration**: Configurable warrant requirements for role assignment
 * - **Temporal Management**: Term length configuration for automatic succession
 * - **Role Assignment**: Automatic role grants upon officer assignment
 * - **Branch Applicability**: Configurable branch type restrictions
 * - **Deputy Relationships**: Support for deputy officer positions
 * - **Administrative Control**: Required office flags and reporting controls
 *
 * ## Database Schema
 * - `id`: Primary key for office identification
 * - `name`: Human-readable office title (unique, required)
 * - `department_id`: Foreign key to parent department
 * - `requires_warrant`: Boolean flag for warrant requirement validation
 * - `required_office`: Boolean flag indicating organizational requirement
 * - `only_one_per_branch`: Boolean constraint for branch-level uniqueness
 * - `can_skip_report`: Boolean permission for reporting exemption
 * - `deputy_to_id`: Foreign key for deputy office relationships
 * - `reports_to_id`: Foreign key for reporting hierarchy
 * - `grants_role_id`: Foreign key to role automatically granted upon assignment
 * - `term_length`: Duration in months for officer terms
 * - `applicable_branch_types`: Serialized array of applicable branch types
 * - `default_contact_address`: Default email contact for the office
 * - Standard audit fields: `created`, `modified`, `created_by`, `modified_by`
 *
 * ## Relationships
 * - **belongsTo Department**: Organizational categorization within departments
 * - **belongsTo GrantsRole**: Automatic role assignment integration
 * - **belongsTo DeputyTo**: Deputy office hierarchy relationships
 * - **belongsTo ReportsTo**: Organizational reporting structure
 * - **hasMany Officers**: Current and historical officer assignments
 * - **hasMany Deputies**: Offices that report as deputies to this office
 * - **hasMany DirectReports**: Offices that report directly to this office
 *
 * ## Hierarchy Management
 * The Office entity implements complex hierarchical relationships through:
 * - Deputy relationships with automatic reporting assignment
 * - Flexible reporting structures independent of deputy relationships
 * - Branch type applicability constraints
 * - Term length management for succession planning
 *
 * ## Warrant Integration
 * Office warrant requirements integrate with the KMP warrant system:
 * - Boolean warrant requirement flags
 * - Automatic role assignment upon officer appointment
 * - Integration with warrant validation workflows
 *
 * ## Usage Patterns
 * ```php
 * // Create a new office with warrant requirements
 * $office = $officesTable->newEntity([
 *     'name' => 'Branch Officer',
 *     'department_id' => $departmentId,
 *     'requires_warrant' => true,
 *     'grants_role_id' => $roleId,
 *     'term_length' => 12,
 *     'branch_types' => ['Local', 'College']
 * ]);
 * 
 * // Set up deputy relationship
 * $deputyOffice = $officesTable->newEntity([
 *     'name' => 'Deputy Branch Officer',
 *     'deputy_to_id' => $office->id
 * ]);
 * 
 * // Check office hierarchy
 * if ($office->is_deputy) {
 *     $parentOffice = $office->deputy_to;
 * }
 * ```
 *

     * Fields that can be mass assigned using newEntity() or patchEntity().
     *
     * ## Security Configuration
     * Mass assignment protection allows controlled data modification while
     * preventing unauthorized field access. The accessible fields include:
     *
     * - `name`: Office title for identification
     * - `department_id`: Department organizational assignment
     * - `requires_warrant`: Warrant requirement configuration
     * - `can_skip_report`: Reporting exemption permission
     * - `required_office`: Organizational requirement flag
     * - `only_one_per_branch`: Branch uniqueness constraint
     * - `deputy_to_id`: Deputy relationship hierarchy
     * - `reports_to_id`: Reporting relationship hierarchy
     * - `grants_role_id`: Automatic role assignment configuration
     * - `term_length`: Officer term duration in months
     * - `branch_types`: Branch type applicability array
     * - `default_contact_address`: Default office contact email
     * - `deleted`: Soft deletion timestamp
     * - Relationship entities: `department`, `officers`
     *
     * ## Security Considerations
     * - Primary key (`id`) is intentionally excluded from mass assignment
     * - Audit fields are managed automatically through BaseEntity
     * - All accessible fields undergo validation before persistence
     * - Deputy and reporting relationships are mutually managed
     *
     * ## Usage Example
     * ```php
     * // Safe mass assignment with hierarchy
     * $office = $officesTable->patchEntity($office, [
     *     'name' => 'Updated Office Title',
     *     'requires_warrant' => true,
     *     'deputy_to_id' => $parentOfficeId,
     *     'term_length' => 24

    /**
     * Deputy-to relationship setter with automatic reporting assignment
     *
     * When a deputy relationship is established, the reporting relationship

     * that deputy offices report to their parent office.
     *
     * ## Business Logic
     * - Setting `deputy_to_id` automatically sets `reports_to_id` to the same value
     * - Maintains hierarchical consistency between deputy and reporting relationships
     * - Supports organizational structure with clear chain of command
     *
     * ## Usage Example
     * ```php

     * When a direct reporting relationship is established that differs from
     * a deputy relationship, the deputy relationship is cleared to prevent

     *
     * ## Business Logic
     * - Setting `reports_to_id` clears `deputy_to_id` to prevent conflicts
     * - Allows flexible reporting structures independent of deputy relationships

/**
 * ## Office Entity Usage Examples
 *
 * ### Office Creation and Configuration
 * ```php
 * // Create a standard office with warrant requirements
 * $officesTable = TableRegistry::getTableLocator()->get('Officers.Offices');
 * $office = $officesTable->newEntity([
 *     'name' => 'Branch Officer',
 *     'department_id' => $operationsDepartmentId,
 *     'requires_warrant' => true,
 *     'grants_role_id' => $branchOfficerRoleId,
 *     'term_length' => 12, // 12 months
 *     'branch_types' => ['Local', 'College'],
 *     'required_office' => true,
 *     'only_one_per_branch' => true
 * ]);
 * $officesTable->save($office);
 * 
 * // Create a deputy office with automatic reporting
 * $deputyOffice = $officesTable->newEntity([
 *     'name' => 'Deputy Branch Officer',
 *     'department_id' => $operationsDepartmentId,
 *     'deputy_to_id' => $office->id, // Automatically sets reports_to_id
 *     'requires_warrant' => false,
 *     'term_length' => 12
 * ]);
 * $officesTable->save($deputyOffice);
 * ```
 *
 * ### Hierarchy Management
 * ```php
 * // Check office hierarchy relationships
 * $office = $officesTable->get($officeId, [
 *     'contain' => ['DeputyTo', 'ReportsTo', 'Deputies', 'DirectReports']
 * ]);
 * 
 * if ($office->is_deputy) {
 *     echo "Deputy to: " . $office->deputy_to->name;
 *     echo "Reports to: " . $office->reports_to->name; // Same as deputy_to

 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Branch Type Management
 * ```php
 * // Set branch types for office applicability
 * $office->branch_types = ['Local', 'College', 'Household'];
 * $officesTable->save($office);
 * 
 * // Check if office applies to specific branch type
 * $branchTypes = $office->branch_types;
 * if (in_array('Local', $branchTypes)) {

 * }
 * 
 * // Clear branch type restrictions (applies to all)
 * $office->branch_types = [];
 * $officesTable->save($office);
 * ```
 *
 * ### Officer Assignment Integration
 * ```php

 * ```
 *
 * ### Warrant and Role Integration
 * ```php
 * // Office with warrant requirements and role grants
 * $office = $officesTable->get($officeId, [

 * }
 * 
 * // Check term length for succession planning
 * $monthsUntilSuccession = $office->term_length;
 * echo "Officer terms last {$monthsUntilSuccession} months";
 * ```
 *
 * ### Administrative Configuration
 * ```php

 *     echo "Officers in this position must submit regular reports";
 * }
 * 
 * if ($office->only_one_per_branch) {
 *     echo "Only one person can hold this office per branch";
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Reporting and Analytics
 * ```php

 *     $upcomingCount = count($office->upcoming_officers);
 *     
 *     echo "Office: {$office->name}";
 *     echo "Department: {$office->department->name}";
 *     echo "Current Officers: {$currentCount}";
 *     echo "Upcoming Officers: {$upcomingCount}";
 *     
 *     if ($office->required_office && $currentCount === 0) {
 *         echo "WARNING: Required office is unfilled!";
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Hierarchical Queries
 * ```php
 * // Find all offices in a department hierarchy
 * $departmentOffices = $officesTable->find()
 *     ->where(['department_id' => $departmentId])
 *     ->contain(['DeputyTo', 'ReportsTo'])
 *     ->orderBy(['deputy_to_id' => 'ASC', 'name' => 'ASC']);
 * 
 * // Group by hierarchy level

 *     'deputy' => []
 * ];
 * 
 * foreach ($departmentOffices as $office) {
 *     if ($office->is_deputy) {
 *         $hierarchy['deputy'][] = $office;
 *     } else {
 *         $hierarchy['primary'][] = $office;
 *     }
 * }
 * 
 * // Find offices requiring specific branch types
 * $localOffices = $officesTable->find()
