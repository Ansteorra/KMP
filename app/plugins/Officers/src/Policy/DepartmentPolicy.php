/**
 * Department Authorization Policy
 * 
 * Provides comprehensive authorization control for Department entities within the KMP Officers plugin.
 * This policy class implements entity-level access control for departmental operations including
 * viewing, creation, modification, and deletion of organizational departments.
 * 
 * The DepartmentPolicy integrates with KMP's role-based access control (RBAC) system to enforce
 * department-specific permissions and organizational hierarchy constraints. It provides granular
 * control over department management operations while maintaining organizational privacy and
 * administrative oversight capabilities.
 * 
 * ## Authorization Architecture
 * 
 * **BasePolicy Integration**: Extends the KMP BasePolicy framework to leverage centralized
 * permission checking, warrant validation, and organizational scoping capabilities.
 * 
 * **Permission-Based Access Control**: Utilizes the PermissionsLoader system to evaluate
 * department-specific permissions including viewing, administrative management, and organizational
 * access control.
 * 
 * **Entity-Level Authorization**: Provides fine-grained authorization at the individual department
 * level, enabling context-aware access control based on organizational relationships and
 * administrative hierarchy.
 * 
 * **Warrant Integration**: Integrates with the warrant system to validate administrative authority
 * and organizational management permissions for department operations.
 * 
 * ## Department Operations Governance
 * 
 * **Department Viewing**: Controls access to department information including organizational
 * structure, associated offices, and administrative details based on user permissions and
 * organizational relationships.
 * 
 * **Administrative Management**: Enforces authorization for department creation, modification,
 * and administrative operations including organizational restructuring and hierarchy management.
 * 
 * **Organizational Access Control**: Manages access to departmental data based on branch
 * affiliations, administrative roles, and organizational hierarchy positioning.
 * 
 * **Privacy Protection**: Implements privacy controls for departmental information including
 * organizational structure details and administrative management capabilities.
 * 
 * ## Security Implementation
 * 
 * **Multi-Level Validation**: Implements comprehensive authorization checking at multiple levels
 * including entity access, operation authorization, and organizational scope validation.
 * 
 * **Administrative Oversight**: Provides administrative override capabilities for authorized
 * personnel while maintaining audit trail and accountability for departmental operations.
 * 
 * **Branch Scoping**: Integrates branch-based access control to ensure users only access
 * departmental information within their authorized organizational scope.
 * 
 * **Audit Trail Integration**: Supports comprehensive audit logging for department authorization
 * decisions and administrative access patterns.
 * 
 * ## Integration Points
 * 
 * **DepartmentsController**: Provides authorization services for department management controllers
 * including CRUD operations, administrative interfaces, and organizational navigation.
 * 
 * **Officers Plugin**: Integrates with the broader Officers plugin ecosystem including office
 * management, assignment workflows, and organizational reporting systems.
 * 
 * **RBAC System**: Leverages KMP's comprehensive role-based access control system for permission
 * validation and organizational hierarchy enforcement.
 * 
 * **Organizational Hierarchy**: Coordinates with office management and assignment systems to
 * maintain consistent authorization across the organizational structure.
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ```php
 * // Entity-level department authorization in controller
 * $this->Authorization->authorize($department);
 * 
 * // Permission-based department access checking
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($department, 'view')) {
 *     // Display department information
 * }
 * 
 * // Administrative department management authorization
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($department, 'edit')) {
 *     // Enable department modification interface
 * }
 * 
 * // Organizational access control validation
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($department, 'seeAllDepartments')) {
 *     // Display comprehensive departmental listing
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Performance Considerations
 * 
 * **Permission Caching**: Leverages BasePolicy caching mechanisms to optimize repeated
 * authorization checks and improve response times for department operations.
 * 
 * **Efficient Queries**: Implements optimized permission checking to minimize database
 * overhead during department authorization validation.
 * 
 * **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large organizational structures with
 * efficient authorization checking and minimal performance impact.

    /**
     * Authorization method for comprehensive departmental access control
     * 
     * This method provides comprehensive access control for viewing all departments within the
     * organizational hierarchy. It implements permission-based authorization to determine whether
     * a user has sufficient privileges to access the complete departmental structure including
     * organizational overview, administrative management, and cross-departmental reporting.
     * 
     * ## Authorization Logic
     * 
     * **Permission Validation**: Utilizes the BasePolicy _hasPolicy() method to evaluate the
     * 'canSeeAllDepartments' permission through the PermissionsLoader system, ensuring consistent
     * authorization across the Officers plugin ecosystem.
     * 
     * **Organizational Scope**: Validates access to the comprehensive departmental listing
     * including cross-departmental information, administrative details, and organizational
     * structure navigation capabilities.
     * 
     * **Administrative Oversight**: Supports administrative access patterns for authorized
     * personnel including organizational management, departmental oversight, and comprehensive
     * reporting access.
     * 
     * **Branch Integration**: Coordinates with branch-based access control to ensure users
     * receive appropriate departmental information based on their organizational affiliations
     * and administrative authority.
     * 
     * ## Security Validation
     * 
     * **Entity Context Validation**: Validates the provided entity context to ensure proper
     * authorization scope and prevent unauthorized access to departmental information.
     * 
     * **Multi-Level Authorization**: Implements comprehensive authorization checking including
     * user identity validation, permission evaluation, and organizational scope verification.
     * 
     * **Privacy Protection**: Ensures departmental information access is properly controlled
     * based on organizational relationships and administrative authority.
     * 
     * **Audit Trail Support**: Coordinates with audit systems to track departmental access
     * patterns and authorization decisions for compliance and security monitoring.
     * 
     * ## Performance Optimization
     * 
     * **Efficient Permission Checking**: Leverages BasePolicy optimization patterns to minimize
     * database overhead during authorization validation while maintaining security integrity.
     * 
     * **Caching Integration**: Utilizes permission caching mechanisms to improve response times
     * for repeated departmental access authorization checks.
     * 
     * **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large organizational structures with
     * efficient authorization validation and minimal performance impact.
     * 
     * ## Integration Context
     * 
     * **DepartmentsController**: Provides authorization services for comprehensive departmental
     * listing, administrative interfaces, and organizational navigation features.
     * 
     * **Reporting Systems**: Enables access control for departmental reporting, analytics,
     * and organizational structure visualization tools.

     * // Controller authorization for comprehensive departmental access
     * if ($this->Authorization->can($department, 'seeAllDepartments')) {
     *     $departments = $this->Departments->find('all')->contain(['Offices']);
     *     $this->set(compact('departments'));
     * }
     * 
     * // Service layer authorization validation
     * if ($this->departmentPolicy->canSeeAllDepartments($user, $department)) {
     *     return $this->generateComprehensiveReport();
     * }
     * 
     * // Administrative interface authorization
     * $canManageAll = $this->Authorization->can($department, 'seeAllDepartments');
     * $this->set('showAdminInterface', $canManageAll);
     * ```
     * 
     * @param KmpIdentityInterface $user The authenticated user requesting departmental access
     * @param BaseEntity $entity The department entity or related entity providing authorization context
     * @return bool True if the user is authorized to view all departments, false otherwise
     * 
     * @see BasePolicy::_hasPolicy() For underlying permission validation logic
