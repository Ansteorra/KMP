/**
 * Office Authorization Policy
 * 
 * Provides comprehensive authorization control for Office entities within the KMP Officers plugin.
 * This policy class implements entity-level access control for office operations including
 * viewing, creation, modification, deletion, and hierarchical management of organizational
 * offices within the departmental structure.
 * 
 * The OfficePolicy integrates with KMP's role-based access control (RBAC) system to enforce
 * office-specific permissions, hierarchical constraints, and warrant integration requirements.
 * It provides granular control over office management operations while maintaining organizational
 * hierarchy integrity and administrative oversight capabilities.
 * 
 * ## Authorization Architecture
 * 
 * **BasePolicy Integration**: Extends the KMP BasePolicy framework to leverage centralized
 * permission checking, warrant validation, and organizational scoping capabilities for
 * office-specific authorization requirements.
 * 
 * **Entity-Level Authorization**: Provides fine-grained authorization at the individual
 * office level, enabling context-aware access control based on hierarchical relationships,
 * warrant requirements, and administrative authority.
 * 
 * **Hierarchical Access Control**: Manages authorization for hierarchical office operations
 * including deputy relationships, reporting structures, and organizational tree navigation
 * while maintaining integrity and administrative oversight.
 * 
 * **Warrant Integration**: Coordinates with the warrant system to validate administrative
 * authority and role assignment permissions for office management and assignment operations.
 * 
 * ## Office Operations Governance
 * 
 * **Office Viewing**: Controls access to office information including hierarchical structure,
 * warrant requirements, role assignments, and administrative details based on user permissions
 * and organizational relationships.
 * 
 * **Administrative Management**: Enforces authorization for office creation, modification,
 * deletion, and administrative operations including hierarchical restructuring and warrant
 * requirement management.
 * 
 * **Hierarchical Management**: Manages access to hierarchical office operations including
 * deputy assignment, reporting structure modification, and organizational tree management
 * based on administrative authority and warrant validation.
 * 
 * **Assignment Authorization**: Provides authorization control for officer assignment
 * operations including warrant validation, role grants, and temporal assignment management
 * within the office hierarchy.
 * 
 * ## Security Implementation
 * 
 * **Multi-Level Validation**: Implements comprehensive authorization checking at multiple
 * levels including entity access, operation authorization, hierarchical scope validation,
 * and warrant requirement verification.
 * 
 * **Administrative Oversight**: Provides administrative override capabilities for authorized
 * personnel while maintaining audit trail and accountability for office management operations
 * and hierarchical modifications.
 * 
 * **Branch Scoping**: Integrates branch-based access control to ensure users only access
 * office information within their authorized organizational scope and administrative authority.
 * 
 * **Warrant Validation**: Enforces warrant requirements for office operations including
 * assignment authority validation, role grant verification, and administrative management
 * permission checking.
 * 
 * ## Hierarchical Constraints
 * 
 * **Structural Integrity**: Enforces business rules related to office hierarchy including
 * deputy relationship validation, reporting structure consistency, and organizational
 * tree integrity maintenance.
 * 
 * **Warrant Requirements**: Validates warrant requirements for office operations including
 * assignment authority, role grants, and administrative management capabilities based
 * on office configuration and organizational hierarchy.
 * 
 * **Administrative Authority**: Manages administrative authority validation for hierarchical
 * operations including office creation, modification, and organizational restructuring
 * based on user permissions and warrant status.
 * 
 * **Organizational Consistency**: Ensures office operations maintain consistency with
 * broader organizational structure including departmental relationships and administrative
 * hierarchy constraints.
 * 
 * ## Integration Points
 * 
 * **OfficesController**: Provides authorization services for office management controllers
 * including CRUD operations, hierarchical management interfaces, and assignment workflows.
 * 
 * **Officer Assignment System**: Coordinates with officer assignment workflows to validate
 * authorization for assignment operations, warrant requirements, and role management.
 * 
 * **RBAC System**: Leverages KMP's comprehensive role-based access control system for
 * permission validation and organizational hierarchy enforcement across office operations.
 * 
 * **Warrant System**: Integrates with warrant management to validate assignment authority,
 * role grants, and administrative permissions for office and assignment operations.
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ```php
 * // Entity-level office authorization in controller
 * $this->Authorization->authorize($office);
 * 
 * // Permission-based office access checking
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($office, 'view')) {
 *     // Display office information and hierarchy
 * }
 * 
 * // Administrative office management authorization
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($office, 'edit')) {
 *     // Enable office modification interface
 * }
 * 
 * // Hierarchical management authorization
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($office, 'manageHierarchy')) {
 *     // Enable deputy and reporting structure management
 * }
 * 
 * // Assignment authorization validation
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($office, 'assignOfficer')) {
 *     // Enable officer assignment interface
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Performance Considerations
 * 
 * **Permission Caching**: Leverages BasePolicy caching mechanisms to optimize repeated
 * authorization checks and improve response times for office operations and hierarchical
 * navigation.
 * 
 * **Efficient Queries**: Implements optimized permission checking to minimize database
 * overhead during office authorization validation and hierarchical access control.
 * 
 * **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large organizational hierarchies with
 * efficient authorization checking and minimal performance impact on office operations
 * and assignment workflows.
 * 
 * **Hierarchical Optimization**: Optimizes authorization checking for hierarchical
 * operations to maintain performance while ensuring comprehensive security validation
 * across the organizational tree structure.
 * 
 * ## Business Logic Considerations
 * 
 * **Hierarchical Integrity**: Enforces business rules related to office hierarchy including
 * deputy relationship constraints, reporting structure validation, and organizational
 * consistency requirements.
 * 
 * **Warrant Requirements**: Implements business logic for warrant requirement validation
 * including assignment authority, role grants, and administrative management capabilities
 * based on office configuration.
 * 
 * **Organizational Constraints**: Validates organizational constraints including departmental
 * relationships, administrative authority limits, and hierarchical management boundaries.
 * 
 * **Administrative Workflow**: Supports administrative workflow requirements including
 * approval processes, authorization chains, and administrative oversight for office
 * management operations.
