/**
 * Officers Reports Controller Authorization Policy
 * 
 * Provides comprehensive URL-based authorization control for the Officers ReportsController
 * within the KMP Officers plugin. This policy class implements controller-level access
 * control for officer reporting operations including assignment analytics, organizational
 * reporting, and administrative oversight of officer assignment data and statistics.
 * 
 * The ReportsControllerPolicy extends KMP's BasePolicy framework to provide controller-specific
 * authorization services that govern access to reporting functionality including assignment
 * analytics, warrant compliance reporting, and organizational structure analysis capabilities.
 * 
 * ## Authorization Architecture
 * 
 * **URL-Based Authorization**: Implements URL-based authorization checking through the
 * _hasPolicyForUrl() method to validate access to specific reporting controller actions
 * based on user permissions and organizational context.
 * 
 * **Analytics Access Control**: Provides comprehensive authorization for reporting and
 * analytics operations including assignment reporting, organizational analysis, and
 * administrative oversight capabilities.
 * 
 * **Organizational Context Validation**: Integrates organizational context validation
 * to ensure reporting operations respect branch boundaries, administrative authority
 * structures, and hierarchical access constraints.
 * 
 * **Compliance Monitoring**: Manages authorization for compliance-related reporting
 * including warrant status analysis, assignment compliance monitoring, and
 * administrative oversight reporting.
 * 
 * ## Reporting Operations Governance
 * 
 * **Assignment Analytics**: Controls access to assignment analytics functionality
 * including officer assignment reporting, organizational analysis, and administrative
 * oversight of assignment patterns and compliance.
 * 
 * **Departmental Reporting**: Manages authorization for departmental reporting operations
 * including department-based officer rosters, organizational structure analysis, and
 * administrative departmental oversight.
 * 
 * **Warrant Compliance Reporting**: Provides authorization control for warrant compliance
 * reporting including status analysis, compliance monitoring, and administrative
 * warrant oversight through reporting interfaces.
 * 
 * **Organizational Analysis**: Enforces authorization for organizational analysis
 * including structure reporting, assignment patterns, and comprehensive organizational
 * oversight and analytics capabilities.
 * 
 * ## Security Implementation
 * 
 * **Multi-Level Validation**: Implements comprehensive authorization checking including
 * URL-based validation, organizational scope verification, administrative authority
 * confirmation, and data privacy protection.
 * 
 * **Data Privacy Protection**: Enforces privacy controls for reporting operations
 * including member information protection, organizational data safeguards, and
 * administrative access limitations based on authority and scope.
 * 
 * **Administrative Oversight**: Provides administrative override capabilities for
 * authorized personnel while maintaining audit trail and accountability for reporting
 * operations and organizational data access.
 * 
 * **Access Control Integration**: Integrates with broader access control systems to
 * ensure reporting operations respect organizational boundaries and administrative
 * authority structures.
 * 
 * ## Integration Points
 * 
 * **ReportsController**: Provides direct authorization services for reporting controller
 * actions including assignment analytics, departmental reporting, and administrative
 * oversight interfaces.
 * 
 * **Assignment System**: Coordinates with assignment management to validate authorization
 * for assignment-related reporting including analytics, compliance monitoring, and
 * administrative oversight through reporting interfaces.
 * 
 * **Organizational Hierarchy**: Integrates with organizational structure management
 * to ensure reporting operations respect hierarchical relationships and administrative
 * authority boundaries.
 * 
 * **RBAC System**: Leverages KMP's comprehensive role-based access control system
 * for permission validation and organizational hierarchy enforcement across reporting
 * operations.
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ```php
 * // URL-based authorization for departmental reporting
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($request, 'departmentOfficersRoster')) {
 *     // Enable departmental officer roster reporting
 * }
 * 
 * // Controller action authorization checking
 * $this->Authorization->authorize($request, 'departmentOfficersRoster');
 * 
 * // Administrative reporting access validation
 * $canAccessReports = $this->Authorization->can($request, 'departmentOfficersRoster');
 * $this->set('showReportingInterface', $canAccessReports);
 * 
 * // Organizational context authorization
 * $urlProps = ['department' => $departmentId, 'branch' => $branchId];
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($urlProps, 'departmentOfficersRoster')) {
 *     // Process departmental reporting request
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Performance Considerations
 * 
 * **Efficient URL Validation**: Utilizes BasePolicy optimization patterns to minimize
 * authorization overhead during URL-based validation while maintaining comprehensive
 * security checking for reporting operations.
 * 
 * **Permission Caching**: Leverages BasePolicy caching mechanisms to improve response
 * times for repeated authorization checks and reporting operation validation.
 * 
 * **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large organizational structures with
 * efficient authorization checking and minimal performance impact on reporting operations
 * and analytics generation.
 * 
 * **Reporting Optimization**: Implements efficient authorization patterns for reporting
 * operations to maintain performance while ensuring comprehensive security validation
 * and data privacy protection.
 * 
 * ## Business Logic Considerations
 * 
 * **Organizational Constraints**: Enforces business rules related to reporting operations
 * including organizational hierarchy integrity, administrative authority validation,
 * and data privacy compliance.
 * 
 * **Compliance Reporting**: Implements business logic for compliance-related reporting
 * operations including warrant status monitoring, assignment compliance validation,
 * and administrative oversight capabilities.
 * 
 * **Administrative Workflow**: Supports administrative workflow requirements including
 * approval processes, authorization chains, and administrative oversight for reporting
 * management operations.
 * 
 * **Data Privacy Compliance**: Provides authorization framework support for data privacy
 * compliance and organizational governance requirements related to reporting operations
 * and member information protection.
