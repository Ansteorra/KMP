/**
 * Departments Table Authorization Policy
 * 
 * Provides comprehensive table-level authorization control for Departments table operations
 * within the KMP Officers plugin. This policy class implements query-level access control,
 * bulk operation authorization, and administrative data access management for departmental
 * information and organizational structure operations.
 * 
 * The DepartmentsTablePolicy extends KMP's BasePolicy framework to provide table-level
 * authorization services that complement entity-level DepartmentPolicy controls. It focuses
 * on bulk operations, query scoping, administrative data access, and organizational
 * structure management across the departmental hierarchy.
 * 
 * ## Authorization Architecture
 * 
 * **BasePolicy Integration**: Leverages the comprehensive BasePolicy framework for
 * permission-based authorization, warrant validation, and organizational scoping
 * capabilities specific to table-level operations.
 * 
 * **Table-Level Access Control**: Provides authorization services for table-wide operations
 * including bulk queries, administrative data access, organizational reporting, and
 * departmental structure management.
 * 
 * **Query Scoping Support**: Enables permission-based query filtering to ensure users
 * only access departmental information within their authorized organizational scope
 * and administrative authority.
 * 
 * **Bulk Operation Authorization**: Manages authorization for bulk departmental operations
 * including organizational restructuring, administrative updates, and comprehensive
 * reporting generation.
 * 
 * ## Table Operations Governance
 * 
 * **Query Authorization**: Controls access to departmental queries including filtering,
 * sorting, searching, and comprehensive data retrieval based on user permissions and
 * organizational relationships.
 * 
 * **Administrative Data Access**: Manages authorization for administrative table operations
 * including bulk updates, organizational restructuring, and comprehensive departmental
 * management capabilities.
 * 
 * **Organizational Structure Management**: Provides authorization control for operations
 * that affect the broader organizational hierarchy including departmental relationships
 * and administrative oversight.
 * 
 * **Reporting and Analytics**: Enables access control for departmental reporting, analytics
 * generation, and organizational structure visualization based on user authority and
 * organizational scope.
 * 
 * ## Security Implementation
 * 
 * **Multi-Level Authorization**: Implements comprehensive authorization checking for
 * table-level operations including permission validation, organizational scope verification,
 * and administrative authority confirmation.
 * 
 * **Branch Scoping Integration**: Coordinates with branch-based access control to ensure
 * departmental table operations respect organizational boundaries and administrative
 * authority structures.
 * 
 * **Privacy Protection**: Enforces privacy controls for departmental table data including
 * organizational structure information and administrative management capabilities.
 * 
 * **Audit Trail Support**: Integrates with audit systems to track departmental table
 * access patterns and authorization decisions for compliance monitoring and security
 * oversight.
 * 
 * ## Performance Optimization
 * 
 * **Efficient Permission Checking**: Utilizes BasePolicy optimization patterns to minimize
 * authorization overhead during table operations while maintaining comprehensive security
 * validation.
 * 
 * **Query Optimization**: Implements efficient authorization checking for bulk queries
 * and table operations to maintain performance in large organizational structures.
 * 
 * **Caching Integration**: Leverages permission caching mechanisms to improve response
 * times for repeated table authorization checks and bulk operations.
 * 
 * **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large departmental datasets with efficient
 * authorization validation and minimal performance impact on table operations.
 * 
 * ## Integration Points
 * 
 * **DepartmentsController**: Provides table-level authorization services for departmental
 * controllers including bulk operations, administrative interfaces, and reporting systems.
 * 
 * **Service Layer**: Supports authorization for departmental services including
 * organizational management, reporting generation, and administrative workflow systems.
 * 
 * **Reporting Systems**: Enables access control for departmental reporting, analytics,
 * and organizational structure analysis tools and administrative dashboards.
 * 
 * **Export Services**: Manages authorization for departmental data export including
 * organizational structure exports, administrative reports, and compliance documentation.
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ```php
 * // Table-level authorization for bulk departmental operations
 * $this->Authorization->applyScope($departments, 'index');
 * 
 * // Service layer table authorization
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($departmentsTable, 'export')) {
 *     return $this->generateDepartmentalExport();
 * }
 * 
 * // Administrative table access validation
 * $canManageTable = $this->Authorization->can($departmentsTable, 'manage');
 * $this->set('showBulkOperations', $canManageTable);
 * 
 * // Query scoping for organizational access
 * $scopedQuery = $this->Authorization->applyScope($query, 'departmentAccess');
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Business Logic Integration
 * 
 * **Organizational Constraints**: Enforces business rules related to departmental structure
 * including organizational hierarchy integrity and administrative authority validation.
 * 
 * **Workflow Integration**: Coordinates with departmental workflow systems to ensure
 * table operations support organizational management and administrative processes.
 * 
 * **Audit Requirements**: Implements audit trail requirements for departmental table
 * operations including administrative access tracking and organizational change monitoring.
 * 
 * **Compliance Support**: Provides authorization framework support for regulatory compliance
 * and organizational governance requirements related to departmental management.
