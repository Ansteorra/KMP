/**
 * Rosters Controller Authorization Policy
 * 
 * Provides comprehensive URL-based authorization control for the RostersController within
 * the KMP Officers plugin. This policy class implements controller-level access control
 * for roster management operations including roster generation, organizational reporting,
 * and administrative oversight of officer assignment rosters.
 * 
 * The RostersControllerPolicy extends KMP's BasePolicy framework to provide controller-specific
 * authorization services that govern access to roster functionality including warrant
 * processing, organizational reporting, and administrative roster management capabilities.
 * 
 * ## Authorization Architecture
 * 
 * **URL-Based Authorization**: Implements URL-based authorization checking through the
 * _hasPolicyForUrl() method to validate access to specific roster controller actions
 * based on user permissions and organizational context.
 * 
 * **Entity-Based Authorization**: Provides entity-level authorization for roster operations
 * through _hasPolicy() validation, ensuring users have appropriate permissions for
 * specific roster entities and organizational contexts.
 * 
 * **Dynamic Entity Creation**: Supports authorization for operations involving dynamic
 * entity creation including new roster entities and warrant roster processing with
 * appropriate permission validation.
 * 
 * **Administrative Access Control**: Manages authorization for administrative roster
 * operations including organizational oversight, warrant processing, and comprehensive
 * roster management capabilities.
 * 
 * ## Roster Operations Governance
 * 
 * **Roster Generation**: Controls access to roster generation functionality including
 * organizational reporting, warrant processing, and administrative roster creation
 * based on user permissions and organizational scope.
 * 
 * **Warrant Processing**: Manages authorization for warrant-related roster operations
 * including bulk warrant requests, roster-based warrant processing, and administrative
 * warrant management through roster interfaces.
 * 
 * **Organizational Reporting**: Provides authorization control for organizational
 * reporting through roster interfaces including department-based reporting,
 * organizational structure visualization, and administrative oversight.
 * 
 * **Administrative Management**: Enforces authorization for administrative roster
 * management including roster configuration, organizational oversight, and
 * comprehensive roster administration capabilities.
 * 
 * ## Security Implementation
 * 
 * **Multi-Level Validation**: Implements comprehensive authorization checking including
 * URL-based validation, entity-level authorization, organizational scope verification,
 * and administrative authority confirmation.
 * 
 * **Organizational Scoping**: Integrates organizational context validation to ensure
 * roster operations respect branch boundaries, administrative authority structures,
 * and hierarchical access constraints.
 * 
 * **Privacy Protection**: Enforces privacy controls for roster operations including
 * organizational information protection, member privacy safeguards, and administrative
 * access limitations.
 * 
 * **Administrative Oversight**: Provides administrative override capabilities for
 * authorized personnel while maintaining audit trail and accountability for roster
 * operations and organizational reporting.
 * 
 * ## Integration Points
 * 
 * **RostersController**: Provides direct authorization services for roster controller
 * actions including roster generation, warrant processing, and administrative
 * management interfaces.
 * 
 * **Warrant System**: Coordinates with warrant management to validate authorization
 * for warrant-related roster operations including bulk processing and administrative
 * warrant management through roster interfaces.
 * 
 * **Organizational Hierarchy**: Integrates with organizational structure management
 * to ensure roster operations respect hierarchical relationships and administrative
 * authority boundaries.
 * 
 * **RBAC System**: Leverages KMP's comprehensive role-based access control system
 * for permission validation and organizational hierarchy enforcement across roster
 * operations.
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ```php
 * // URL-based authorization for roster creation
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($request, 'createRoster')) {
 *     // Enable roster creation interface
 * }
 * 
 * // Entity-based authorization for roster addition
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($rosterEntity, 'add')) {
 *     // Process roster addition request
 * }
 * 
 * // Controller action authorization checking
 * $this->Authorization->authorize($request, 'createRoster');
 * 
 * // Dynamic entity authorization for new rosters
 * $newRoster = $this->WarrantRosters->newEntity();
 * $this->Authorization->authorize($newRoster, 'add');
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Performance Considerations
 * 
 * **Efficient URL Validation**: Utilizes BasePolicy optimization patterns to minimize
 * authorization overhead during URL-based validation while maintaining comprehensive
 * security checking for roster operations.
 * 
 * **Entity Creation Optimization**: Implements efficient entity creation patterns for
 * authorization checking to minimize database overhead while ensuring proper
 * security validation.
 * 
 * **Permission Caching**: Leverages BasePolicy caching mechanisms to improve response
 * times for repeated authorization checks and roster operation validation.
 * 
 * **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large organizational structures with
 * efficient authorization checking and minimal performance impact on roster operations.
 * 
 * ## Business Logic Considerations
 * 
 * **Organizational Constraints**: Enforces business rules related to roster operations
 * including organizational hierarchy integrity, administrative authority validation,
 * and warrant requirement compliance.
 * 
 * **Warrant Integration**: Implements business logic for warrant-related roster
 * operations including requirement validation, bulk processing authorization, and
 * administrative warrant management capabilities.
 * 
 * **Administrative Workflow**: Supports administrative workflow requirements including
 * approval processes, authorization chains, and administrative oversight for roster
 * management operations.
 * 
 * **Compliance Support**: Provides authorization framework support for regulatory
 * compliance and organizational governance requirements related to roster management
 * and organizational reporting.

     * Authorization method for roster addition access control
     * 
     * This method provides entity-based authorization control for roster addition operations.
     * It implements sophisticated entity handling including dynamic entity creation and
     * comprehensive permission validation to determine whether a user has sufficient
     * authority to add rosters to the organizational structure.
     * 
     * ## Authorization Logic
     * 
     * **Dynamic Entity Handling**: Implements flexible entity processing to handle
     * Table objects, array data, and BaseEntity instances, ensuring consistent
     * authorization regardless of the entity source or creation method.
     *

     * creates appropriate WarrantRoster entities to enable proper authorization
     * validation against the created entity context.
     * 
     * **Permission Validation**: Utilizes the BasePolicy _hasPolicy() method to evaluate
     * the 'canAdd' permission against the processed entity, ensuring consistent
     * authorization across roster addition workflows.
     * 
     * **Administrative Authority**: Validates administrative authority for roster addition
     * including organizational management, warrant processing capabilities, and
     * comprehensive roster administration permissions.
     * 
     * ## Entity Processing Patterns
     * 
     * **Table Object Handling**: When provided with a Table object, creates a new
     * empty entity to enable authorization validation against the table context
     * and organizational scope.
     * 
     * **Array Data Processing**: When provided with array data, creates a new
     * WarrantRoster entity populated with the provided data to enable comprehensive
     * authorization validation against the specific roster context.
     * 
     * **Entity Passthrough**: When provided with a BaseEntity, processes the entity
     * directly for authorization validation without additional transformation.
     * 
     * **Context Preservation**: Maintains entity context throughout the authorization
     * process to ensure proper validation of organizational scope and administrative
     * authority.
     * 
     * ## Security Implementation
     * 
     * **Multi-Format Authorization**: Implements authorization checking across multiple
     * entity formats while maintaining consistent security validation and organizational
     * scope verification.
     * 
     * **Dynamic Entity Security**: Ensures dynamic entity creation processes maintain
     * proper security context and authorization validation without bypassing
     * security controls.
     * 
     * **Administrative Validation**: Validates administrative authority for roster
     * addition including organizational oversight, warrant management, and
     * comprehensive administrative control.
     * 
     * @param KmpIdentityInterface $user The authenticated user requesting roster addition access
     * @param BaseEntity|Table|array $entity The entity, table, or data for authorization validation
