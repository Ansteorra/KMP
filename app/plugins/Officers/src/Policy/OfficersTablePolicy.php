/**
 * Officers Table Authorization Policy
 * 
 * Provides comprehensive table-level authorization control for Officers table operations
 * within the KMP Officers plugin. This policy class implements query-level access control,
 * bulk operation authorization, and administrative data access management for officer
 * assignment information and organizational structure operations.
 * 
 * The OfficersTablePolicy extends KMP's BasePolicy framework to provide table-level
 * authorization services that complement entity-level OfficerPolicy controls. It focuses
 * on bulk operations, query scoping, administrative data access, and assignment
 * management across the officer lifecycle and organizational hierarchy.
 * 
 * ## Authorization Architecture
 * 
 * **BasePolicy Integration**: Leverages the comprehensive BasePolicy framework for
 * permission-based authorization, warrant validation, and organizational scoping
 * capabilities specific to officer table-level operations and assignment management.
 * 
 * **Table-Level Access Control**: Provides authorization services for table-wide operations
 * including bulk queries, administrative data access, assignment reporting, and
 * officer lifecycle management across organizational boundaries.
 * 
 * **Query Scoping Support**: Enables permission-based query filtering to ensure users
 * only access officer assignment information within their authorized organizational
 * scope, administrative authority, and hierarchical relationships.
 * 
 * **Bulk Operation Authorization**: Manages authorization for bulk officer operations
 * including assignment management, warrant processing, administrative updates, and
 * comprehensive reporting generation.
 * 
 * ## Table Operations Governance
 * 
 * **Query Authorization**: Controls access to officer queries including filtering,
 * sorting, searching, assignment navigation, and comprehensive data retrieval based
 * on user permissions and organizational relationships.
 * 
 * **Administrative Data Access**: Manages authorization for administrative table operations
 * including bulk updates, assignment processing, warrant management, and comprehensive
 * officer administration capabilities.
 * 
 * **Assignment Structure Management**: Provides authorization control for operations
 * that affect the broader assignment structure including officer relationships,
 * warrant processing, and administrative oversight.
 * 
 * **Reporting and Analytics**: Enables access control for officer reporting, analytics
 * generation, assignment visualization, and organizational structure analysis based
 * on user authority and organizational scope.
 * 
 * ## Security Implementation
 * 
 * **Multi-Level Authorization**: Implements comprehensive authorization checking for
 * table-level operations including permission validation, organizational scope verification,
 * assignment authority confirmation, and warrant validation.
 * 
 * **Branch Scoping Integration**: Coordinates with branch-based access control to ensure
 * officer table operations respect organizational boundaries, administrative authority
 * structures, and assignment access constraints.
 * 
 * **Privacy Protection**: Enforces privacy controls for officer table data including
 * assignment information, warrant status, administrative management capabilities,
 * and organizational relationship details.
 * 
 * **Audit Trail Support**: Integrates with audit systems to track officer table
 * access patterns, authorization decisions, assignment modifications, and administrative
 * operations for compliance monitoring and security oversight.
 * 
 * ## Assignment Management Support
 * 
 * **Lifecycle Operations**: Enforces authorization for assignment lifecycle operations
 * including creation, modification, termination, and administrative management
 * across the officer assignment workflow.
 * 
 * **Warrant Integration**: Manages authorization for warrant-related table operations
 * including requirement processing, status updates, assignment validation, and
 * administrative warrant management across officer assignments.
 * 
 * **Administrative Authority**: Validates administrative authority for officer table
 * operations including bulk assignment processing, warrant management, organizational
 * reporting, and comprehensive administrative oversight.
 * 
 * **Cross-Office Access**: Manages authorization for cross-office officer operations
 * including organizational reporting, administrative oversight, and comprehensive
 * management capabilities across the office hierarchy.
 * 
 * ## Performance Optimization
 * 
 * **Efficient Permission Checking**: Utilizes BasePolicy optimization patterns to minimize
 * authorization overhead during table operations while maintaining comprehensive security
 * validation for assignment and warrant-related operations.
 * 
 * **Query Optimization**: Implements efficient authorization checking for bulk queries
 * and table operations to maintain performance in large officer assignment datasets
 * with complex organizational relationships.
 * 
 * **Caching Integration**: Leverages permission caching mechanisms to improve response
 * times for repeated table authorization checks, bulk operations, and assignment
 * navigation patterns.
 * 
 * **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large officer assignment datasets with
 * efficient authorization validation and minimal performance impact on table operations
 * and administrative management workflows.
 * 
 * ## Integration Points
 * 
 * **OfficersController**: Provides table-level authorization services for officer
 * controllers including bulk operations, administrative interfaces, assignment
 * management, and reporting systems.
 * 
 * **Service Layer**: Supports authorization for officer services including assignment
 * management, warrant processing, organizational reporting, and administrative
 * workflow systems.
 * 
 * **Reporting Systems**: Enables access control for officer reporting, analytics,
 * assignment analysis tools, organizational dashboards, and administrative
 * oversight interfaces.
 * 
 * **Export Services**: Manages authorization for officer data export including
 * assignment exports, warrant reports, administrative documentation, and
 * compliance reporting.
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ```php
 * // Table-level authorization for bulk officer operations
 * $this->Authorization->applyScope($officers, 'index');
 * 
 * // Service layer table authorization for assignment management
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($officersTable, 'bulkAssign')) {
 *     return $this->processBulkAssignments();
 * }
 * 
 * // Administrative table access validation for warrant operations
 * $canManageWarrants = $this->Authorization->can($officersTable, 'manageWarrants');
 * $this->set('showWarrantOperations', $canManageWarrants);
 * 
 * // Query scoping for assignment access
 * $scopedQuery = $this->Authorization->applyScope($query, 'assignmentAccess');
 * 
 * // Export authorization for officer data
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($officersTable, 'export')) {
 *     return $this->generateOfficerReport();
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Business Logic Integration
 * 
 * **Assignment Constraints**: Enforces business rules related to officer assignments
 * including warrant requirements, office authorization, organizational hierarchy
 * integrity, and administrative authority validation.
 * 
 * **Warrant Management**: Coordinates with warrant system business logic to ensure
 * table operations support warrant requirements, assignment authority validation,
 * and administrative management across officer assignments.
 * 
 * **Audit Requirements**: Implements audit trail requirements for officer table
 * operations including administrative access tracking, assignment change monitoring,
 * and warrant processing documentation.
 * 
 * **Compliance Support**: Provides authorization framework support for regulatory
 * compliance and organizational governance requirements related to officer assignment
 * management and administrative oversight.
