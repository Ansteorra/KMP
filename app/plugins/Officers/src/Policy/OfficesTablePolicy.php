/**
 * Offices Table Authorization Policy
 * 
 * Provides comprehensive table-level authorization control for Offices table operations
 * within the KMP Officers plugin. This policy class implements query-level access control,
 * bulk operation authorization, and administrative data access management for office
 * information and hierarchical organizational structure operations.
 * 
 * The OfficesTablePolicy extends KMP's BasePolicy framework to provide table-level
 * authorization services that complement entity-level OfficePolicy controls. It focuses
 * on bulk operations, query scoping, administrative data access, and hierarchical
 * structure management across the office hierarchy and departmental organization.
 * 
 * ## Authorization Architecture
 * 
 * **BasePolicy Integration**: Leverages the comprehensive BasePolicy framework for
 * permission-based authorization, warrant validation, and organizational scoping
 * capabilities specific to office table-level operations.
 * 
 * **Table-Level Access Control**: Provides authorization services for table-wide operations
 * including bulk queries, administrative data access, hierarchical reporting, and
 * organizational structure management across office hierarchies.
 * 
 * **Query Scoping Support**: Enables permission-based query filtering to ensure users
 * only access office information within their authorized organizational scope,
 * administrative authority, and hierarchical relationships.
 * 
 * **Bulk Operation Authorization**: Manages authorization for bulk office operations
 * including hierarchical restructuring, administrative updates, warrant requirement
 * modifications, and comprehensive reporting generation.
 * 
 * ## Table Operations Governance
 * 
 * **Query Authorization**: Controls access to office queries including filtering, sorting,
 * searching, hierarchical navigation, and comprehensive data retrieval based on user
 * permissions and organizational relationships.
 * 
 * **Administrative Data Access**: Manages authorization for administrative table operations
 * including bulk updates, hierarchical restructuring, warrant requirement management,
 * and comprehensive office administration capabilities.
 * 
 * **Hierarchical Structure Management**: Provides authorization control for operations
 * that affect the broader organizational hierarchy including office relationships,
 * deputy assignments, reporting structures, and administrative oversight.
 * 
 * **Reporting and Analytics**: Enables access control for office reporting, analytics
 * generation, hierarchical visualization, and organizational structure analysis based
 * on user authority and organizational scope.
 * 
 * ## Security Implementation
 * 
 * **Multi-Level Authorization**: Implements comprehensive authorization checking for
 * table-level operations including permission validation, organizational scope verification,
 * hierarchical authority confirmation, and warrant requirement validation.
 * 
 * **Branch Scoping Integration**: Coordinates with branch-based access control to ensure
 * office table operations respect organizational boundaries, administrative authority
 * structures, and hierarchical access constraints.
 * 
 * **Privacy Protection**: Enforces privacy controls for office table data including
 * hierarchical structure information, warrant requirements, administrative management
 * capabilities, and organizational relationship details.
 * 
 * **Audit Trail Support**: Integrates with audit systems to track office table access
 * patterns, authorization decisions, hierarchical modifications, and administrative
 * operations for compliance monitoring and security oversight.
 * 
 * ## Hierarchical Management Support
 * 
 * **Structural Integrity**: Enforces authorization for operations that maintain
 * hierarchical integrity including deputy relationship management, reporting structure
 * validation, and organizational tree consistency.
 * 
 * **Warrant Integration**: Manages authorization for warrant-related table operations
 * including requirement modifications, assignment authority validation, and role
 * grant management across the office hierarchy.
 * 
 * **Administrative Authority**: Validates administrative authority for hierarchical
 * table operations including office creation, modification, deletion, and organizational
 * restructuring based on user permissions and warrant status.
 * 
 * **Cross-Departmental Access**: Manages authorization for cross-departmental office
 * operations including organizational reporting, administrative oversight, and
 * comprehensive hierarchical management.
 * 
 * ## Performance Optimization
 * 
 * **Efficient Permission Checking**: Utilizes BasePolicy optimization patterns to minimize
 * authorization overhead during table operations while maintaining comprehensive security
 * validation for hierarchical and warrant-related operations.
 * 
 * **Query Optimization**: Implements efficient authorization checking for bulk queries
 * and table operations to maintain performance in large hierarchical organizational
 * structures with complex office relationships.
 * 
 * **Caching Integration**: Leverages permission caching mechanisms to improve response
 * times for repeated table authorization checks, bulk operations, and hierarchical
 * navigation patterns.
 * 
 * **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large office hierarchies with efficient
 * authorization validation and minimal performance impact on table operations and
 * administrative management workflows.
 * 
 * ## Integration Points
 * 
 * **OfficesController**: Provides table-level authorization services for office
 * controllers including bulk operations, administrative interfaces, hierarchical
 * management, and reporting systems.
 * 
 * **Service Layer**: Supports authorization for office services including hierarchical
 * management, organizational reporting, administrative workflow systems, and warrant
 * integration services.
 * 
 * **Reporting Systems**: Enables access control for office reporting, analytics,
 * hierarchical structure analysis tools, organizational dashboards, and administrative
 * oversight interfaces.
 * 
 * **Export Services**: Manages authorization for office data export including hierarchical
 * structure exports, administrative reports, warrant requirement documentation, and
 * compliance reporting.
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ```php
 * // Table-level authorization for bulk office operations
 * $this->Authorization->applyScope($offices, 'index');
 * 
 * // Service layer table authorization for hierarchical management
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($officesTable, 'manageHierarchy')) {
 *     return $this->updateOfficeStructure();
 * }
 * 
 * // Administrative table access validation for bulk operations
 * $canManageTable = $this->Authorization->can($officesTable, 'bulkManage');
 * $this->set('showBulkOperations', $canManageTable);
 * 
 * // Query scoping for hierarchical access
 * $scopedQuery = $this->Authorization->applyScope($query, 'hierarchicalAccess');
 * 
 * // Warrant-related table operations authorization
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($officesTable, 'manageWarrantRequirements')) {
 *     return $this->updateWarrantRequirements();
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Business Logic Integration
 * 
 * **Hierarchical Constraints**: Enforces business rules related to office hierarchy
 * including deputy relationship integrity, reporting structure consistency, and
 * organizational tree validation for table-level operations.
 * 
 * **Warrant Integration**: Coordinates with warrant system business logic to ensure
 * table operations support warrant requirements, assignment authority validation,
 * and role management across the office hierarchy.
 * 
 * **Audit Requirements**: Implements audit trail requirements for office table
 * operations including administrative access tracking, hierarchical change monitoring,
 * and warrant requirement modifications.
 * 
 * **Compliance Support**: Provides authorization framework support for regulatory
 * compliance and organizational governance requirements related to office hierarchy
 * management and administrative oversight.
