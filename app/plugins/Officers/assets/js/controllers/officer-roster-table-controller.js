 * selection, selection state tracking, outlet button coordination, and
 * comprehensive table interaction management for efficient roster operations
 * and administrative oversight.
 * 
 * ## Core Functionality
 * 
 * **Row Selection Management**: Manages individual row selection including
 * checkbox state tracking, selection validation, state persistence, and
 * comprehensive selection coordination for accurate roster item management
 * and bulk operation preparation.
 * 
 * **Outlet Button Coordination**: Coordinates with outlet button components
 * including submission button enablement, state synchronization, outlet
 * connection management, and comprehensive button coordination for proper
 * bulk operation workflow and user interface consistency.
 * 
 * **Selection State Tracking**: Tracks selection state across table interactions
 * including ID array management, state persistence, checkbox coordination, and
 * comprehensive state management for reliable selection tracking and operation
 * coordination.
 * 
 * ## Technical Architecture
 * 
 * **Stimulus Framework Integration**: Leverages Stimulus framework patterns
 * including target element management, outlet coordination, event handling,
 * and comprehensive framework integration for consistent controller behavior
 * and optimal user experience.
 * 
 * **Target Element Management**: Manages target elements including row
 * checkboxes, selection tracking, element lifecycle, and comprehensive
 * target coordination for proper table interaction and state management.
 * 
 * **Event-Driven State Management**: Implements event-driven state updates
 * including checkbox change handling, outlet communication, state validation,
 * and comprehensive event coordination for responsive table behavior and
 * administrative efficiency.
 * 
 * ## Performance Optimization
 * 
 * **Efficient ID Management**: Maintains efficient ID array management
 * including array filtering, state updates, memory optimization, and
 * comprehensive ID coordination for scalable roster table operations and
 * optimal browser performance.
 * 
 * **Selective Button Updates**: Implements selective button state updates
 * including conditional enablement, state validation, UI optimization, and
 * comprehensive update coordination for responsive user interface and
 * efficient resource utilization.
 * 
 * **State Synchronization**: Maintains state synchronization including
 * checkbox-button coordination, outlet communication, state consistency,
 * and comprehensive synchronization management for reliable table behavior
 * and administrative workflow.
 * 
 * ## Integration Points
 * 
 * **Officers Plugin Integration**: Integrates with Officers plugin architecture
 * including roster management systems, administrative workflows, bulk operations,
 * and comprehensive plugin coordination for cohesive roster management and
 * organizational administration.
 * 
 * **Outlet System Coordination**: Coordinates with outlet button system
 * including button enablement, outlet lifecycle management, communication
 * protocols, and comprehensive outlet integration for proper bulk operation
 * workflow and user interface consistency.
 * 
 * **Table System Integration**: Integrates with table rendering systems
 * including row management, checkbox coordination, selection tracking, and
 * comprehensive table integration for efficient roster display and interaction
 * management.
