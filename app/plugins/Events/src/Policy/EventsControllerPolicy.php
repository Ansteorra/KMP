/**
 * HelloWorld Policy
 *
 * This policy controls access to the HelloWorld controller and its actions.
 * It demonstrates the authorization patterns used throughout KMP plugins.
 *
 * ## Authorization Architecture
 *
 * KMP uses policy-based authorization where each controller has a corresponding
 * policy class. Policies implement permission checks based on:
 * - User identity and roles
 * - Resource ownership
 * - Warrant/authorization requirements
 * - Branch hierarchy
 * - Custom business rules
 *
 * ## Policy Methods
 *
 * Each controller action has a corresponding canAction() method:
 * - canIndex(): Controls access to list/index views
 * - canView(): Controls access to detail views
 * - canAdd(): Controls ability to create new records
 * - canEdit(): Controls ability to update records
 * - canDelete(): Controls ability to delete records
 *
 * ## Permission Patterns
 *
 * Common permission patterns in KMP:
 * - **Public Access**: Return true for everyone
 * - **Authenticated Only**: Check if user is logged in
 * - **Role-Based**: Check user roles or warrants
 * - **Ownership**: Verify user owns the resource
 * - **Branch Hierarchy**: Check branch permissions
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * This policy demonstrates several common patterns:
 * - Public index access (read-only list)
 * - Authenticated user access for viewing
 * - Role-based access for creating/editing/deleting
 * - Resource-level authorization
