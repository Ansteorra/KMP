/**
 * Events Table Authorization Policy
 * 
 * Provides comprehensive table-level authorization for award event management within the Awards plugin.
 * This policy manages temporal event data access with ceremony coordination, bulk operations,
 * and administrative oversight. The policy handles table-level authorization, temporal structure
 * management, and administrative data access control.
 * 
 * ## Authorization Architecture
 * 
 * The EventsTablePolicy implements table-level authorization through the BasePolicy framework:
 * - **Permission-Based Access**: Controls table operations through warrant-based permissions
 * - **Warrant Integration**: Validates user authority for temporal event management
 * - **Temporal Validation Support**: Manages access to event lifecycle and temporal queries
 * - **Administrative Data Access**: Provides elevated access for event configuration management
 * 
 * ## Table Operations Governance
 * 
 * Authorization is enforced for all table-level operations:
 * - **Query Authorization**: Controls access to event listing and temporal data retrieval
 * - **Temporal Management**: Manages date-based queries and event lifecycle operations
 * - **Structural Modifications**: Restricts bulk event operations and temporal changes
 * - **Administrative Access**: Provides comprehensive event management for authorized users
 * 
 * ## Query Scoping
 * 
 * The policy implements sophisticated query filtering:
 * - Inherits branch-scoped queries from BasePolicy for organizational access control
 * - Supports temporal filtering for event lifecycle management
 * - Implements administrative query scoping for comprehensive event oversight
 * - Validates access to event data and ceremony information
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ### Controller Integration
 * ```php
 * // In EventsController
 * public function index()
 * {
 *     $this->Authorization->authorize($this->Events, 'index');
 *     $events = $this->paginate($this->Events);
 *     // Event listing with temporal ordering...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Temporal Management Services
 * ```php
 * // In event management services
 * $eventsQuery = $this->Events->find()
 *     ->where(['open_date <=' => date('Y-m-d')])
 *     ->order(['open_date' => 'DESC']);
 * $authorizedQuery = $this->Authorization->applyScope($user, 'index', $eventsQuery);
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Administrative Operations
 * ```php
 * // In administrative event management
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($user, 'add', $this->Events)) {
 *     // Bulk event creation with temporal validation...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Business Logic Integration
 * 
 * - **Temporal Constraints**: Validates event operations within temporal boundaries and deadlines
 * - **Workflow Integration**: Coordinates with recommendation system and award workflows
 * - **Audit Requirements**: Supports audit trail and accountability for event management
 * - **Data Integrity**: Ensures temporal consistency and event validation
