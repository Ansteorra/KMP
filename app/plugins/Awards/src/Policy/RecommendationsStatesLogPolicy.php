/**
 * Recommendations States Log Authorization Policy
 * 
 * Provides comprehensive authorization management for recommendation state log entities within
 * the Awards plugin. This policy manages audit trail authorization with transparency control,
 * administrative oversight, and integration with the KMP RBAC system. The policy handles
 * audit authorization, transparency access control, and administrative audit operations.
 * 
 * ## Authorization Architecture
 * 
 * The RecommendationsStatesLogPolicy implements entity-level authorization through the BasePolicy framework:
 * - **Entity-Level Authorization**: Controls access to individual audit log entries based on user permissions
 * - **Warrant Integration**: Validates user authority through warrant-based permission assignments
 * - **Audit Trail Support**: Manages access to state transition history and accountability tracking
 * - **Administrative Oversight**: Provides elevated access for administrative audit management
 * 
 * ## Audit Operations Governance
 * 
 * Authorization is enforced for all audit operations:
 * - **Viewing**: Controls who can access recommendation state transition history
 * - **Querying**: Manages access to audit trail data and accountability information
 * - **Administrative Audit Management**: Restricts comprehensive audit oversight to authorized users
 * - **Transparency Control**: Balances accountability with appropriate access restrictions
 * 
 * ## Audit Trail Security
 * 
 * The policy ensures appropriate audit trail access:
 * - **Read-Only Access**: Audit logs are typically view-only for accountability tracking
 * - **Administrative Visibility**: Provides comprehensive audit access for authorized administrators
 * - **Accountability Tracking**: Supports investigation and compliance through controlled access
 * - **Privacy Protection**: Balances transparency with appropriate privacy considerations
 * 
 * ## Permission Integration
 * 
 * The policy integrates with the KMP permission system:
 * - Inherits standard operations from BasePolicy (canView, canIndex primarily for audit logs)
 * - Uses permission-based authorization through _hasPolicy() method
 * - Supports branch-scoped access through organizational hierarchy
 * - Validates warrant-based authority for audit trail access
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ### Controller Integration
 * ```php
 * // In audit trail controllers
 * public function view($id = null)
 * {
 *     $stateLog = $this->RecommendationsStatesLogs->get($id);
 *     $this->Authorization->authorize($stateLog, 'view');
 *     // Audit log display with accountability context...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Audit Authorization
 * ```php
 * // In audit management services
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($user, 'view', $auditLog)) {
 *     // Display state transition history...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Administrative Audit Operations
 * ```php
 * // In administrative audit interfaces
 * public function index()
 * {
 *     $this->Authorization->authorize($this->RecommendationsStatesLogs, 'index');
 *     // Comprehensive audit trail access...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Business Logic Considerations
 * 
 * - **Audit Integrity**: Ensures audit trail access maintains accountability and transparency
 * - **Transparency Workflow**: Supports investigation and compliance through controlled access
 * - **Compliance Requirements**: Validates audit access within regulatory and organizational requirements
 * - **Privacy Balance**: Balances accountability transparency with appropriate access restrictions
