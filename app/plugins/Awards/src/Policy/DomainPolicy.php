/**
 * Awards Domain Entity Authorization Policy - Organizational Structure Management
 * 
 * The DomainPolicy class provides comprehensive authorization control for Domain entities within
 * the Awards plugin, implementing organizational structure management authorization, categorical
 * access control, and administrative oversight. This policy integrates with the KMP authorization
 * framework to enforce fine-grained access control for award domain management while supporting
 * organizational hierarchy and administrative coordination.
 * 
 * ## Organizational Structure Authorization
 * 
 * The DomainPolicy manages authorization for award categorical organization:
 * - **Categorical Management**: Domain creation and modification authorization for award categorization
 * - **Administrative Oversight**: Domain configuration authorization with administrative permission requirements
 * - **Organizational Integration**: Domain management integrated with branch hierarchy and organizational structure
 * - **System Coordination**: Domain authorization supporting award system coordination and administrative management
 * 
 * ## Domain Management Authorization
 * 
 * ### Entity-Level Access Control
 * The policy inherits comprehensive entity authorization through BasePolicy standard methods:
 * - **View Permission**: Domain viewing controlled through canView() with organizational access validation
 * - **Creation Authority**: Domain creation through canAdd() with administrative permission requirements
 * - **Modification Rights**: Domain editing through canEdit() with entity-level authorization and referential integrity protection
 * - **Deletion Control**: Domain removal through canDelete() with award relationship validation and business rule enforcement
 * 
 * ### Categorical Operations
 * All domain-specific operations leverage the inherited BasePolicy framework:
 * - **Category Management**: Award domain organization with categorical structure and administrative oversight
 * - **Administrative Configuration**: Domain configuration management with permission-based access control
 * - **Award Integration**: Domain-award relationship management with hierarchical authorization and validation
 * - **Reporting Access**: Domain analytics and reporting with organizational scoping and administrative visibility
 * 
 * ## Permission Framework Integration
 * 
 * ### BasePolicy Delegation Pattern
 * The DomainPolicy follows the delegation pattern for consistent authorization:
 * - **Method Delegation**: All authorization decisions delegated to BasePolicy._hasPolicy() for centralized permission checking
 * - **Permission Discovery**: Automatic permission resolution through PermissionsLoader integration and warrant validation
 * - **Administrative Authority**: Domain management authority through warrant-based permission checking and role validation
 * - **Error Handling**: Consistent authorization failure handling with logging and administrative visibility
 * 
 * ### Warrant-Based Authorization
 * Integration with the warrant system provides authority-based validation:
 * - **Administrative Authority**: Domain management authority through warrant-based permission checking and role validation
 * - **Temporal Control**: Time-bounded authorization through ActiveWindow integration and warrant expiration management
 * - **System Oversight**: Administrative authority support for award system management and domain coordination
 * - **Audit Integration**: Authorization decisions logged for compliance monitoring and administrative review
 * 
 * ## Organizational Access Control
 * 
 * ### Administrative Management
 * Domain access controlled through administrative hierarchy:
 * - **Administrative Permissions**: Domain operations require administrative authority and appropriate permissions
 * - **System Management**: Global domain management for award system coordination and administrative oversight
 * - **Organizational Integration**: Domain management integrated with organizational structure and branch hierarchy
 * - **Configuration Control**: Domain configuration authorization with administrative oversight and validation requirements
 * 
 * ### Referential Integrity Protection
 * The policy supports domain integrity through relationship validation:
 * - **Award Relationships**: Domain deletion authorized only when award relationships are properly managed
 * - **Categorical Integrity**: Domain modifications respect award categorization and organizational requirements
 * - **Administrative Coordination**: Domain management coordinated with award system administration and oversight
 * - **Business Rule Enforcement**: Domain operations validated against business rules and organizational constraints
 * 
 * ## Security Architecture
 * 
 * ### Access Control Implementation
 * The policy implements administrative security through BasePolicy integration:
 * - **Authentication Required**: All operations require authenticated user identity through KmpIdentityInterface validation
 * - **Permission Validation**: Domain operations validated against administrative permissions through centralized policy checking
 * - **Administrative Authorization**: Domain-specific authorization through administrative access control and oversight validation
 * - **System Protection**: Domain data protection through administrative permission requirements and access control
 * 
 * ### Authorization Flow
 * Standard authorization flow through BasePolicy framework:
 * 1. **Super User Check**: Administrative override through BasePolicy.before() for system management operations
 * 2. **Permission Discovery**: Domain operation permissions resolved through PermissionsLoader and warrant integration
 * 3. **Administrative Validation**: Administrative access validation through warrant-based permission checking
 * 4. **Entity Authorization**: Domain-specific authorization through entity-level access control and business rule validation
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ### Controller Integration
 * ```php
 * // Standard CRUD authorization in DomainsController
 * public function view($id) {
 *     $domain = $this->Domains->get($id);
 *     $this->Authorization->authorize($domain); // Uses canView() delegation
 *     $this->set(compact('domain'));
 * }
 * 
 * public function edit($id) {
 *     $domain = $this->Domains->get($id);
 *     $this->Authorization->authorize($domain); // Uses canEdit() delegation
 *     // Edit processing...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Administrative Operations
 * ```php
 * // Administrative domain management with policy validation
 * public function createDomain($domainData) {
 *     if (!$this->Authorization->can($this->Domains, 'add')) {
 *         throw new ForbiddenException('Not authorized to create domains');
 *     }
 *     
 *     $domain = $this->Domains->newEntity($domainData);
 *     return $this->Domains->save($domain);
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Domain Configuration Management
 * ```php
 * // Domain configuration with authorization validation
 * public function configureDomain($domainId, $configData) {
 *     $domain = $this->Domains->get($domainId);
 *     
 *     if (!$this->Authorization->can($domain, 'edit')) {
 *         throw new ForbiddenException('Not authorized to configure domain');
 *     }
 *     
 *     $this->Domains->patchEntity($domain, $configData);
 *     return $this->Domains->save($domain);
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Referential Integrity Validation
 * ```php
 * // Domain deletion with referential integrity checking
 * public function deleteDomain($domainId) {
 *     $domain = $this->Domains->get($domainId, ['contain' => ['Awards']]);
 *     
 *     if (!$this->Authorization->can($domain, 'delete')) {
 *         throw new ForbiddenException('Not authorized to delete domain');
 *     }
 *     
 *     if (!empty($domain->awards)) {
 *         throw new BadRequestException('Cannot delete domain with associated awards');
 *     }
 *     
 *     return $this->Domains->delete($domain);
 * }
 * ```
