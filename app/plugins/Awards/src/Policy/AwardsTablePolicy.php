/**
 * Awards Table Authorization Policy - Bulk Operations and Query Scoping
 * 
 * The AwardsTablePolicy class provides comprehensive table-level authorization for Awards
 * data operations, implementing query scoping, bulk operation authorization, and approval
 * level filtering based on user permissions. This policy integrates with the Awards
 * recommendation system to provide fine-grained access control based on approval
 * authority and organizational hierarchy.
 * 
 * ## Table-Level Authorization Architecture
 * 
 * The AwardsTablePolicy implements sophisticated query scoping and filtering:
 * - **Query Scoping**: Awards table queries filtered based on user permissions and approval authority
 * - **Branch Integration**: Awards access controlled through branch-based scoping and organizational hierarchy
 * - **Approval Level Filtering**: Awards filtered by approval levels user has authority to manage
 * - **Permission Integration**: Seamless integration with PermissionsLoader and warrant-based authorization
 * 
 * ## Query Scoping Implementation
 * 
 * ### Branch-Based Data Access
 * The policy implements comprehensive branch scoping for organizational data isolation:
 * - **Branch Discovery**: User branch permissions resolved through _getBranchIdsForPolicy() integration
 * - **Query Filtering**: Awards table queries automatically scoped to authorized branch contexts
 * - **Hierarchical Access**: Parent-child branch relationships supported for organizational award management
 * - **Administrative Override**: Global permissions bypass branch restrictions for administrative operations
 * 
 * ### Approval Level Authorization
 * Sophisticated approval level filtering based on recommendation permissions:
 * - **Permission Analysis**: User policies analyzed for 'canApproveLevel*' methods to determine approval authority
 * - **Level Extraction**: Award level names extracted from permission method names for filtering
 * - **Dynamic Filtering**: Awards filtered to only show those at levels user can approve
 * - **Recommendation Integration**: Approval authority derived from RecommendationPolicy permissions
 * 
 * ## Bulk Operations Authorization
 * 
 * ### Table Query Authorization
 * The policy inherits standard table operations through BasePolicy:
 * - **Index Operations**: Awards listing authorized through canIndex() delegation with query scoping
 * - **Export Authorization**: Awards export operations controlled through permission-based access validation
 * - **Bulk Updates**: Mass award operations authorized through individual entity permission checking
 * - **Administrative Operations**: Bulk administrative operations with appropriate permission validation
 * 
 * ### Query Optimization
 * Performance-optimized query scoping for large award datasets:
 * - **Efficient Filtering**: Branch and level filtering applied at database level for optimal performance
 * - **Association Loading**: Strategic containment of Levels association for approval authority validation
 * - **Index Utilization**: Query scoping designed to utilize database indexes for efficient data access
 * - **Caching Integration**: Branch and permission data cached for improved query performance
 * 
 * ## Permission Integration Architecture
 * 
 * ### BasePolicy Delegation
 * Standard authorization operations delegated to BasePolicy framework:
 * - **Permission Discovery**: Award table permissions resolved through PermissionsLoader integration
 * - **Warrant Validation**: Table operations authorized through warrant-based authority checking
 * - **Branch Scoping**: Organizational access control through branch-based permission validation
 * - **Administrative Authority**: Super user and administrative permissions supported for system management
 * 
 * ### Recommendation Policy Integration
 * Dynamic approval authority discovery through RecommendationPolicy analysis:
 * - **Policy Analysis**: User permissions analyzed to discover approval authority levels
 * - **Method Extraction**: canApproveLevel* methods parsed to determine specific level permissions
 * - **Dynamic Filtering**: Awards filtered based on discovered approval authority for workflow optimization
 * - **Cross-Policy Integration**: Seamless integration between table and entity policies for consistent authorization
 * 
 * ## Organizational Access Control
 * 
 * ### Multi-Branch Support
 * The policy supports complex organizational structures:
 * - **Branch Hierarchy**: Awards access controlled through organizational hierarchy and parent-child relationships
 * - **Cross-Branch Operations**: Administrative users can access awards across organizational boundaries
 * - **Data Isolation**: Branch-based data scoping ensures organizational security and appropriate access control
 * - **Reporting Integration**: Organizational award analytics with proper scoping and permission validation
 * 
 * ### Administrative Oversight
 * Comprehensive administrative access control:
 * - **Global Access**: Administrative users can access all awards regardless of branch restrictions
 * - **System Management**: Award system administration with appropriate oversight and audit capabilities
 * - **Bulk Operations**: Administrative bulk operations with proper authorization and audit trail integration
 * - **Compliance Monitoring**: Administrative access supports compliance monitoring and regulatory requirements
 * 
 * ## Security Implementation
 * 
 * ### Query Security
 * Comprehensive query-level security implementation:
 * - **Injection Prevention**: Query scoping implemented through parameterized queries and ORM integration
 * - **Access Validation**: All query operations validated against user permissions and organizational hierarchy
 * - **Data Filtering**: Awards data automatically filtered to prevent unauthorized access to organizational information
 * - **Audit Integration**: Query operations logged for compliance monitoring and administrative review
 * 
 * ### Performance Security
 * Security implementation optimized for performance:
 * - **Efficient Scoping**: Query scoping implemented at database level for optimal performance
 * - **Permission Caching**: User permissions cached to reduce authorization overhead

 * // AwardsController index with automatic query scoping
 * public function index() {
 *     $query = $this->Awards->find();
 *     $query = $this->Authorization->applyScope($query); // Uses scopeIndex()
 *     $awards = $this->paginate($query);
 *     $this->set(compact('awards'));
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Service Layer Integration
 * ```php
 * // Award discovery service with policy scoping
 * public function getAuthorizedAwards($filters = []) {
 *     $query = $this->Awards->find()
 *         ->where($filters);
 *     
 *     // Automatic scoping based on user permissions
 *     $query = $this->Authorization->applyScope($query);
 *     return $query->toArray();
 * }
 * ```
 *

 *     
 *     if ($branchId) {
 *         $query = $query->where(['Awards.branch_id' => $branchId]);
 *     }
 *     
 *     // Policy automatically filters to authorized awards
 *     $query = $this->Authorization->applyScope($query);
 *     return $query->toArray();
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Approval Authority Filtering
 * ```php

class AwardsTablePolicy extends BasePolicy

    /**
     * Apply query scoping for Awards index operations based on user permissions and approval authority
     * 
     * This method implements sophisticated query scoping that filters awards based on the user's
     * branch permissions and recommendation approval authority. Awards are automatically filtered
     * to show only those within authorized branches and at levels the user has approval authority for.
     * 
     * ## Scoping Logic Implementation
     * 
     * The scoping process follows these steps:
     * 1. **Branch Permission Discovery**: User's branch permissions resolved through _getBranchIdsForPolicy()
     * 2. **Policy Analysis**: User policies analyzed to discover recommendation approval authority
     * 3. **Level Extraction**: Award levels extracted from 'canApproveLevel*' permission methods
     * 4. **Query Filtering**: Awards filtered by authorized branches and approval levels
     * 
     * ## Branch-Based Filtering
     * 
     * Awards access is controlled through organizational hierarchy:
     * - Branch permissions discovered through BasePolicy._getBranchIdsForPolicy() integration
     * - AwardsTable.addBranchScopeQuery() applied for organizational data isolation
     * - Empty branch list allows global access for administrative users
     * - Multi-branch support for complex organizational structures
     * 
     * ## Approval Level Filtering
     * 
     * Awards filtered based on recommendation approval authority:
     * - User policies analyzed for RecommendationPolicy permissions
     * - Methods starting with 'canApproveLevel' parsed to extract level names
     * - Awards filtered to only show those at levels user can approve
     * - Levels association contained for efficient filtering and data access
     * 
     * @param \App\KMP\KmpIdentityInterface $user The authenticated user requesting access
     * @param \Cake\ORM\Query\SelectQuery $query The Awards table query to be scoped
     * @return \Cake\ORM\Query\SelectQuery The scoped query with branch and level filtering applied
     * 
     * @example Basic Usage
     * ```php
     * // Controller usage with automatic scoping
     * $query = $this->Awards->find();
     * $query = $this->Authorization->applyScope($query);
     * $awards = $this->paginate($query);
     * ```
     * 
     * @example Service Layer Integration
     * ```php
     * // Service method with policy scoping
     * public function getManageableAwards() {
     *     $query = $this->Awards->find()->contain(['Domains', 'Levels']);
     *     return $this->Authorization->applyScope($query)->toArray();
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * @example Administrative Access
     * ```php
     * // Administrative user sees all awards (empty branch restrictions)
     * // Regular user sees only branch-scoped awards at authorized levels
     * $query = $this->Authorization->applyScope($this->Awards->find());
     * ```
     */
    public function scopeIndex(KmpIdentityInterface $user, $query)
    {
        $table = $query->getRepository();
        $branchIds = $this->_getBranchIdsForPolicy($user, "canIndex");
        if (empty($branchIds)) {
            return $query;
        }
        $branchPolicies = $user->getPolicies($branchIds);
        $approvaLevels = [];
        $recommendationPolicies = $branchPolicies["Awards\Policy\RecommendationPolicy"]
            ?? [];
        foreach ($recommendationPolicies as $method => $policy) {
            //if the method name starts with 'canApproveLevel' then lets get the level
            if (strpos($method, 'canApproveLevel') === 0) {
                $level = str_replace("canApproveLevel", "", $method);
                $approvaLevels[] = $level;
            }
        }
        $query = $table->addBranchScopeQuery($query, $branchIds);
        if (!empty($approvaLevels)) {
            return $query->contain(['Levels'])->where(['Levels.name in' => $approvaLevels]);
        }
        return $query;
    }
