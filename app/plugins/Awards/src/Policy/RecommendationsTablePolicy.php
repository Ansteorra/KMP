/**
 * Recommendations Table Authorization Policy
 * 
 * Provides comprehensive table-level authorization for recommendation workflow management within
 * the Awards plugin. This policy manages recommendation data access with workflow scoping, bulk
 * operations, and administrative oversight. The policy handles table-level authorization,
 * workflow structure management, and administrative data access control.
 * 
 * ## Authorization Architecture
 * 
 * The RecommendationsTablePolicy implements table-level authorization through the BasePolicy framework:
 * - **Permission-Based Access**: Controls table operations through warrant-based permissions
 * - **Warrant Integration**: Validates user authority for recommendation workflow management
 * - **Workflow Scoping Support**: Manages access to recommendation lifecycle and approval operations
 * - **Administrative Data Access**: Provides elevated access for recommendation oversight
 * 
 * ## Table Operations Governance
 * 
 * Authorization is enforced for all table-level operations:
 * - **Query Authorization**: Controls access to recommendation listing and workflow data retrieval
 * - **Workflow Management**: Manages state-based queries and approval level filtering
 * - **State-Based Filtering**: Restricts recommendation access based on approval authority
 * - **Administrative Access**: Provides comprehensive recommendation management for authorized users
 * 
 * ## Advanced Query Scoping
 * 
 * ### scopeIndex()
 * Implements sophisticated recommendation filtering based on user approval authority and
 * organizational scope. The method performs multi-level authorization checking:
 * 
 * 1. **Branch-Based Scoping**: Filters recommendations by organizational branch access
 * 2. **Approval Level Discovery**: Analyzes user permissions to identify approval authority
 * 3. **Dynamic Filtering**: Restricts recommendations to user's approval levels
 * 4. **Permission Integration**: Uses RecommendationPolicy analysis for dynamic authorization
 * 
 * The scoping logic discovers approval levels by analyzing user policies for methods
 * starting with 'canApproveLevel', then filters recommendations to only show those
 * at award levels the user can approve.
 * 
 * ```php
 * // Branch scoping with approval level filtering
 * $query = $table->addBranchScopeQuery($query, $branchIds);
 * $query = $query->contain(['Awards.Levels'])
 *     ->where(['Levels.name in' => $approvalLevels]);
 * ```
 * 
 * ### canAdd()
 * Provides open access for recommendation submission, supporting both authenticated
 * and unauthenticated recommendation creation. This enables public recommendation
 * submission workflows while maintaining security through entity-level policies.
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ### Controller Integration
 * ```php
 * // In RecommendationsController
 * public function index()
 * {
 *     $this->Authorization->authorize($this->Recommendations, 'index');
 *     $recommendations = $this->paginate($this->Recommendations);
 *     // Recommendation listing with approval level filtering...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Workflow Management Services
 * ```php
 * // In recommendation management services
 * $query = $this->Recommendations->find()
 *     ->contain(['Awards', 'Events', 'Members']);
 * $authorizedQuery = $this->Authorization->applyScope($user, 'index', $query);
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Administrative Operations
 * ```php
 * // In administrative recommendation management
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($user, 'add', $this->Recommendations)) {
 *     // Bulk recommendation processing with workflow validation...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Business Logic Integration
 * 
 * - **Workflow Constraints**: Validates recommendation operations within workflow rules and state management
 * - **State Management**: Coordinates with recommendation state machine and approval workflows
 * - **Audit Requirements**: Supports audit trail and accountability for recommendation management
 * - **Data Integrity**: Ensures workflow consistency and approval authority validation
