/**
 * Recommendations States Log Table Authorization Policy
 * 
 * Provides comprehensive table-level authorization for recommendation audit trail management
 * within the Awards plugin. This policy manages audit data access with transparency control,
 * bulk operations, and administrative oversight. The policy handles table-level authorization,
 * audit structure management, and administrative data access control.
 * 
 * ## Authorization Architecture
 * 
 * The RecommendationsStatesLogTablePolicy implements table-level authorization through the BasePolicy framework:
 * - **Permission-Based Access**: Controls table operations through warrant-based permissions
 * - **Warrant Integration**: Validates user authority for audit trail management
 * - **Audit Scoping Support**: Manages access to state transition history and accountability data
 * - **Administrative Data Access**: Provides elevated access for comprehensive audit management
 * 
 * ## Table Operations Governance
 * 
 * Authorization is enforced for all table-level operations:
 * - **Query Authorization**: Controls access to audit trail listing and historical data retrieval
 * - **Audit Management**: Manages accountability-based queries and compliance reporting
 * - **Compliance Filtering**: Restricts audit access based on organizational and regulatory requirements
 * - **Administrative Access**: Provides comprehensive audit management for authorized users
 * 
 * ## Query Scoping
 * 
 * The policy implements sophisticated query filtering for audit data:
 * - Inherits branch-scoped queries from BasePolicy for organizational access control
 * - Supports accountability-based filtering for audit trail management
 * - Implements administrative query scoping for comprehensive audit oversight
 * - Validates access to state transition history and compliance data
 * 
 * ## Audit Trail Security
 * 
 * The policy ensures appropriate audit trail access:
 * - **Read-Only Operations**: Audit logs are primarily view-only for accountability
 * - **Organizational Scoping**: Filters audit data by organizational boundaries
 * - **Compliance Support**: Enables investigation and compliance through controlled access
 * - **Privacy Protection**: Balances transparency with appropriate privacy considerations
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ### Controller Integration
 * ```php
 * // In audit trail controllers
 * public function index()
 * {
 *     $this->Authorization->authorize($this->RecommendationsStatesLogs, 'index');
 *     $auditLogs = $this->paginate($this->RecommendationsStatesLogs);
 *     // Audit trail listing with accountability context...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Audit Management Services
 * ```php
 * // In audit management services
 * $auditQuery = $this->RecommendationsStatesLogs->find()
 *     ->contain(['Recommendations', 'Users'])
 *     ->order(['created' => 'DESC']);
 * $authorizedQuery = $this->Authorization->applyScope($user, 'index', $auditQuery);
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Administrative Operations
 * ```php
 * // In administrative audit management
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($user, 'index', $this->RecommendationsStatesLogs)) {
 *     // Comprehensive audit trail access with compliance reporting...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Business Logic Integration
 * 
 * - **Audit Constraints**: Validates audit operations within accountability and transparency requirements
 * - **Compliance Integration**: Coordinates with regulatory compliance and organizational audit requirements
 * - **Transparency Requirements**: Supports investigation and accountability through controlled data access
 * - **Data Integrity**: Ensures audit trail consistency and accountability validation
