/**
 * Awards Award Entity Authorization Policy - RBAC Integration and Award-Specific Permission Validation
 * 
 * The AwardPolicy class provides comprehensive authorization control for Award entities within
 * the Awards plugin, implementing RBAC integration, award-specific permission validation, and
 * organizational access control. This policy integrates with the KMP authorization framework
 * to enforce fine-grained access control for award management operations while supporting
 * branch-based scoping and administrative oversight.
 * 
 * ## RBAC Integration Architecture
 * 
 * The AwardPolicy leverages the KMP RBAC system through BasePolicy inheritance:
 * - **Permission-Based Authorization**: All authorization decisions delegated to BasePolicy._hasPolicy() for consistent RBAC integration
 * - **Branch Scoping**: Award access controlled through branch-based data scoping for organizational security
 * - **Administrative Oversight**: Super user privileges support administrative award management and system oversight
 * - **Warrant Integration**: Permission validation through warrant-based authority checking and temporal validation
 * 
 * ## Award Management Authorization
 * 
 * ### Entity-Level Access Control
 * The policy inherits comprehensive entity authorization through BasePolicy standard methods:
 * - **View Permission**: Award viewing controlled through canView() with branch-scoped access validation
 * - **Creation Authority**: Award creation through canAdd() with administrative permission requirements
 * - **Modification Rights**: Award editing through canEdit() with entity-level authorization and data integrity protection
 * - **Deletion Control**: Award removal through canDelete() with referential integrity validation and business rule enforcement
 * 
 * ### Award-Specific Operations
 * All award-specific operations leverage the inherited BasePolicy framework:
 * - **Hierarchical Management**: Award hierarchy operations with domain/level integration and organizational validation
 * - **Configuration Control**: Award configuration management with administrative oversight and validation frameworks
 * - **Recommendation Integration**: Award-recommendation relationship management with workflow authorization and state validation
 * - **Reporting Access**: Award analytics and reporting with permission-based access control and organizational scoping
 * 
 * ## Permission Framework Integration
 * 
 * ### BasePolicy Delegation Pattern
 * The AwardPolicy follows the delegation pattern for consistent authorization:
 * - **Method Delegation**: All authorization decisions delegated to BasePolicy._hasPolicy() for centralized permission checking
 * - **Permission Discovery**: Automatic permission resolution through PermissionsLoader integration and warrant validation
 * - **Branch Scoping**: Organizational access control through branch-based entity scoping and administrative hierarchy
 * - **Error Handling**: Consistent authorization failure handling with logging and administrative visibility
 * 
 * ### Warrant-Based Authorization
 * Integration with the warrant system provides temporal and authority-based validation:
 * - **Authority Validation**: Award management authority through warrant-based permission checking and role validation
 * - **Temporal Control**: Time-bounded authorization through ActiveWindow integration and warrant expiration management
 * - **Administrative Oversight**: Super user and administrative authority support for award system management
 * - **Audit Integration**: Authorization decisions logged for compliance monitoring and administrative review
 * 
 * ## Organizational Access Control
 * 
 * ### Branch-Based Scoping
 * Award access controlled through organizational hierarchy integration:
 * - **Branch Scoping**: Award entity access limited to authorized branch contexts through getBranchId() validation
 * - **Hierarchical Access**: Parent-child branch relationships supported for organizational award management
 * - **Administrative Override**: Global permissions support cross-branch award management for administrative users
 * - **Data Isolation**: Branch-based data isolation ensuring organizational security and access control
 * 
 * ### Multi-Branch Support
 * The policy supports complex organizational structures:
 * - **Cross-Branch Awards**: Global awards accessible across organizational boundaries with appropriate permissions
 * - **Local Awards**: Branch-specific awards with restricted access and organizational validation
 * - **Administrative Management**: Cross-organizational award management for administrative users and system oversight
 * - **Reporting Integration**: Branch-scoped reporting with administrative visibility and organizational analytics
 * 
 * ## Security Architecture
 * 
 * ### Access Control Implementation
 * The policy implements multi-layer security through BasePolicy integration:
 * - **Authentication Required**: All operations require authenticated user identity through KmpIdentityInterface validation
 * - **Permission Validation**: Award operations validated against RBAC permissions through centralized policy checking
 * - **Entity Authorization**: Award-specific authorization through entity-level access control and ownership validation
 * - **Data Protection**: Award data protection through branch scoping and organizational access control
 * 
 * ### Authorization Flow
 * Standard authorization flow through BasePolicy framework:
 * 1. **Super User Check**: Administrative override through BasePolicy.before() for system management operations
 * 2. **Permission Discovery**: Award operation permissions resolved through PermissionsLoader and warrant integration
 * 3. **Branch Validation**: Organizational access validation through branch scoping and hierarchical authorization
 * 4. **Entity Authorization**: Award-specific authorization through entity-level access control and business rule validation
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ### Controller Integration
 * ```php
 * // Standard CRUD authorization in AwardsController
 * public function view($id) {
 *     $award = $this->Awards->get($id);
 *     $this->Authorization->authorize($award); // Uses canView() delegation
 *     $this->set(compact('award'));
 * }
 * 
 * public function edit($id) {
 *     $award = $this->Awards->get($id);
 *     $this->Authorization->authorize($award); // Uses canEdit() delegation
 *     // Edit processing...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Service Layer Authorization
 * ```php
 * // Award management service with policy validation
 * public function updateAward($awardId, $data) {
 *     $award = $this->Awards->get($awardId);
 *     if (!$this->Authorization->can($award, 'edit')) {
 *         throw new ForbiddenException('Not authorized to edit award');
 *     }
 *     return $this->Awards->patchEntity($award, $data);
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Administrative Operations
 * ```php
 * // Administrative award management with policy checking
 * public function bulkUpdateAwards($awardIds, $updateData) {
 *     foreach ($awardIds as $awardId) {
 *         $award = $this->Awards->get($awardId);
 *         if ($this->Authorization->can($award, 'edit')) {
 *             $this->Awards->patchEntity($award, $updateData);
 *             $this->Awards->save($award);
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Branch-Scoped Operations
 * ```php
 * // Branch-specific award discovery with policy integration
 * public function getBranchAwards($branchId) {
 *     $query = $this->Awards->find()
 *         ->where(['branch_id' => $branchId]);
 *     
 *     // Policy automatically validates branch access through BasePolicy
 *     return $this->Authorization->applyScope($query);
 * }
 * ```
