/**
 * Awards Domains Table Authorization Policy - Organizational Management and Bulk Operations
 * 
 * The DomainsTablePolicy class provides comprehensive table-level authorization for Domains
 * data operations, implementing administrative access control, organizational management authorization,
 * and bulk operation governance. This policy integrates with the Awards system to provide
 * fine-grained access control for domain management operations while supporting administrative
 * oversight and organizational hierarchy.
 * 
 * ## Table-Level Authorization Architecture
 * 
 * The DomainsTablePolicy implements administrative table authorization:
 * - **Administrative Access**: Domains table operations controlled through administrative permission requirements
 * - **Organizational Management**: Domain data access managed through organizational hierarchy and administrative authority
 * - **Bulk Operations**: Mass domain operations authorized through administrative permission validation
 * - **System Coordination**: Domain table authorization supporting award system coordination and management
 * 
 * ## Administrative Data Access
 * 
 * ### Permission-Based Authorization
 * The policy implements administrative authorization through BasePolicy integration:
 * - **Administrative Requirements**: All domain table operations require administrative authority and appropriate permissions
 * - **Permission Validation**: Domain operations validated against administrative permissions through centralized policy checking
 * - **Warrant Integration**: Table operations authorized through warrant-based administrative authority validation
 * - **System Management**: Administrative domain access for award system management and coordination
 * 
 * ### Organizational Structure Management
 * Domain table access controlled through organizational hierarchy:
 * - **Administrative Authority**: Domain management authority through administrative permission validation and oversight
 * - **System Coordination**: Domain operations coordinated with award system administration and organizational management
 * - **Configuration Management**: Domain configuration access through administrative authority and validation requirements
 * - **Audit Integration**: Domain table operations logged for administrative oversight and compliance monitoring
 * 
 * ## Bulk Operations Authorization
 * 
 * ### Administrative Operations
 * The policy inherits administrative table operations through BasePolicy:
 * - **Index Operations**: Domain listing authorized through administrative permission validation and access control
 * - **Export Authorization**: Domain export operations controlled through administrative authority and permission checking
 * - **Bulk Updates**: Mass domain operations authorized through administrative permission validation and oversight
 * - **Configuration Operations**: Bulk domain configuration through administrative authority and validation requirements
 * 
 * ### System Management Operations
 * Administrative bulk operations for award system management:
 * - **Domain Creation**: Bulk domain creation through administrative authority and validation frameworks
 * - **Configuration Updates**: Mass domain configuration updates with administrative oversight and validation
 * - **Referential Management**: Domain relationship management through administrative coordination and integrity validation
 * - **System Coordination**: Bulk operations supporting award system administration and organizational management
 * 
 * ## Permission Integration Architecture
 * 
 * ### BasePolicy Delegation
 * Administrative authorization operations delegated to BasePolicy framework:
 * - **Permission Discovery**: Domain table permissions resolved through PermissionsLoader and administrative integration
 * - **Warrant Validation**: Table operations authorized through warrant-based administrative authority checking
 * - **Administrative Authority**: Administrative permissions validated for domain system management and coordination
 * - **System Oversight**: Administrative access control supporting award system management and organizational oversight
 * 
 * ### Administrative Framework Integration
 * Seamless integration with administrative authorization systems:
 * - **Administrative Permissions**: Domain table operations require appropriate administrative authority and validation
 * - **System Management**: Administrative access control for domain configuration and award system coordination
 * - **Configuration Authority**: Domain system configuration through administrative permission validation and oversight
 * - **Audit Requirements**: Administrative operations logged for compliance monitoring and system oversight
 * 
 * ## Organizational Access Control
 * 
 * ### Administrative Management
 * The policy supports administrative organizational management:
 * - **System Administration**: Administrative users can manage domains for award system coordination and oversight
 * - **Configuration Management**: Domain configuration operations through administrative authority and validation requirements
 * - **Organizational Coordination**: Domain management integrated with organizational structure and administrative hierarchy
 * - **Award System Integration**: Domain operations coordinated with award system administration and management
 * 
 * ### Business Logic Integration
 * Comprehensive business logic validation for domain operations:
 * - **Referential Integrity**: Domain operations validated against award relationships and organizational constraints
 * - **Administrative Workflow**: Domain management through administrative workflow and validation requirements
 * - **Organizational Constraints**: Domain operations respect organizational hierarchy and administrative requirements
 * - **System Coordination**: Domain table operations coordinated with award system business logic and management
 * 
 * ## Security Implementation
 * 
 * ### Administrative Security
 * Comprehensive administrative security implementation:
 * - **Authentication Required**: All domain table operations require authenticated administrative user identity
 * - **Permission Validation**: Domain operations validated against administrative permissions and authority requirements
 * - **Administrative Control**: Domain data access limited to administrative users and authorized system management
 * - **Audit Integration**: Table operations logged for administrative oversight and compliance monitoring
 * 
 * ### Data Protection
 * Administrative data protection for domain operations:
 * - **Administrative Access**: Domain data access controlled through administrative permission validation and authority
 * - **Configuration Security**: Domain configuration protected through administrative authorization and validation requirements
 * - **System Protection**: Domain table operations secured through administrative access control and oversight
 * - **Operational Security**: Domain operations maintain system integrity through administrative validation and coordination
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ### Controller Integration
 * ```php
 * // DomainsController index with administrative authorization
 * public function index() {
 *     $this->Authorization->authorize($this->Domains); // Administrative access required
 *     $query = $this->Domains->find();
 *     $domains = $this->paginate($query);
 *     $this->set(compact('domains'));
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Administrative Service Integration
 * ```php
 * // Administrative domain management service
 * public function manageDomainsForAwardSystem() {
 *     if (!$this->Authorization->can($this->Domains, 'index')) {
 *         throw new ForbiddenException('Administrative access required');
 *     }
 *     
 *     return $this->Domains->find()->toArray();
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Bulk Administrative Operations
 * ```php
 * // Administrative bulk domain operations
 * public function bulkUpdateDomains($domainUpdates) {
 *     if (!$this->Authorization->can($this->Domains, 'index')) {
 *         throw new ForbiddenException('Administrative access required');
 *     }
 *     
 *     foreach ($domainUpdates as $update) {
 *         $domain = $this->Domains->get($update['id']);
 *         if ($this->Authorization->can($domain, 'edit')) {
 *             $this->Domains->patchEntity($domain, $update['data']);
 *             $this->Domains->save($domain);
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Configuration Management
 * ```php
 * // Administrative domain configuration operations
 * public function configureAwardDomains($configurationData) {
 *     if (!$this->Authorization->can($this->Domains, 'add')) {
 *         throw new ForbiddenException('Administrative configuration access required');
 *     }
 *     
 *     // Administrative domain configuration logic
 *     return $this->implementDomainConfiguration($configurationData);
 * }
 * ```
