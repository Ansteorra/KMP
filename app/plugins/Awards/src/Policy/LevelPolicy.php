/**
 * Level Authorization Policy
 * 
 * Provides comprehensive authorization management for award level entities within the Awards plugin.
 * This policy manages hierarchical level authorization with precedence control, administrative oversight,
 * and integration with the KMP RBAC system. The policy handles level management authorization,
 * precedence access control, and administrative level operations.
 * 
 * ## Authorization Architecture
 * 
 * The LevelPolicy implements entity-level authorization through the BasePolicy framework:
 * - **Entity-Level Authorization**: Controls access to individual Level entities based on user permissions
 * - **Warrant Integration**: Validates user authority through warrant-based permission assignments
 * - **Hierarchical Precedence Support**: Manages access to level hierarchy and precedence operations
 * - **Administrative Oversight**: Provides elevated access for administrative level management
 * 
 * ## Level Operations Governance
 * 
 * Authorization is enforced for all level operations:
 * - **Creation**: Controls who can create new award levels and define precedence
 * - **Modification**: Manages access to level editing and precedence adjustment
 * - **Deletion**: Restricts level removal with precedence integrity protection
 * - **Precedence Management**: Controls hierarchical ordering and level relationship operations
 * 
 * ## Permission Integration
 * 
 * The policy integrates with the KMP permission system:
 * - Inherits standard CRUD operations from BasePolicy (canAdd, canEdit, canDelete, canView, canIndex)
 * - Uses permission-based authorization through _hasPolicy() method
 * - Supports branch-scoped access through organizational hierarchy
 * - Validates warrant-based authority for level management operations
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ### Controller Integration
 * ```php
 * // In LevelsController
 * public function edit($id = null)
 * {
 *     $level = $this->Levels->get($id);
 *     $this->Authorization->authorize($level, 'edit');
 *     // Level editing logic...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Service Layer Authorization
 * ```php
 * // In level management services
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($user, 'add', $this->Levels)) {
 *     // Create new level...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Administrative Level Operations
 * ```php
 * // In administrative interfaces
 * public function delete($id = null)
 * {
 *     $level = $this->Levels->get($id);
 *     $this->Authorization->authorize($level, 'delete');
 *     // Level deletion with precedence validation...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Business Logic Considerations
 * 
 * - **Precedence Integrity**: Ensures level deletion maintains hierarchical consistency
 * - **Administrative Workflow**: Supports administrative level management and configuration
 * - **Hierarchical Constraints**: Validates level operations within award hierarchy rules
 * - **Integration Requirements**: Coordinates with awards system and recommendation workflows
