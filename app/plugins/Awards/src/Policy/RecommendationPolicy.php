/**
 * Awards Recommendation Entity Authorization Policy - State Machine Management and Workflow Control
 * 
 * The RecommendationPolicy class provides comprehensive authorization control for Recommendation
 * entities within the Awards plugin, implementing sophisticated state machine management,
 * workflow authorization, and approval level validation. This policy integrates with the
 * KMP authorization framework to enforce fine-grained access control for recommendation
 * lifecycle operations while supporting dynamic approval authority and organizational oversight.
 * 
 * ## State Machine Authorization Architecture
 * 
 * The RecommendationPolicy implements complex workflow authorization:
 * - **State Transition Control**: Recommendation state changes authorized through workflow permissions and approval authority
 * - **Approval Level Authorization**: Dynamic approval authority based on award level and user permissions
 * - **Workflow Management**: Recommendation lifecycle operations controlled through state-aware authorization
 * - **Administrative Oversight**: Administrative operations supporting recommendation workflow management and system coordination
 * 
 * ## Dynamic Approval Authority
 * 
 * ### Level-Based Authorization
 * The policy implements dynamic approval authority through level-specific permissions:
 * - **Dynamic Methods**: canApproveLevel* methods generated dynamically based on award levels
 * - **Level Discovery**: Award levels discovered from LevelsTable for dynamic permission generation
 * - **Authority Validation**: Approval authority validated against specific award levels and user permissions
 * - **Workflow Integration**: Level-based approval integrated with recommendation state machine and workflow processing
 * 
 * ### Magic Method Implementation
 * Sophisticated dynamic method handling for approval authority:
 * - **__call() Method**: Dynamic canApproveLevel* method resolution through magic method implementation
 * - **Method Discovery**: Dynamic method discovery through getDynamicMethods() for policy introspection
 * - **Permission Integration**: Dynamic methods integrated with BasePolicy._hasPolicy() for consistent authorization
 * - **Error Handling**: Appropriate error handling for undefined method calls and validation failures
 * 
 * ## Recommendation Workflow Authorization
 * 
 * ### Workflow Operations
 * The policy provides comprehensive workflow operation authorization:
 * - **Submission Authority**: Recommendation submission through canAdd() with open submission support
 * - **State Management**: Recommendation state transitions through canUpdateStates() with approval authority validation
 * - **Board Management**: Kanban board access through canUseBoard() with workflow visualization authorization
 * - **Export Operations**: Recommendation data export through canExport() with appropriate access control
 * 
 * ### Member-Specific Authorization
 * Sophisticated member-based authorization for recommendation access:
 * - **Requester Access**: Recommendations visible to submitting members through canViewSubmittedByMember()
 * - **Subject Access**: Recommendations visible for members being recommended through canViewSubmittedForMember()
 * - **Event Access**: Event-based recommendation access through canViewEventRecommendations()
 * - **Administrative Access**: Administrative recommendation management through comprehensive permission validation
 * 
 * ## Permission Framework Integration
 * 
 * ### BasePolicy Delegation Pattern
 * The RecommendationPolicy leverages BasePolicy for consistent authorization:
 * - **Standard Operations**: Inherits canView(), canEdit(), canDelete() through BasePolicy delegation
 * - **Permission Discovery**: Automatic permission resolution through PermissionsLoader integration and warrant validation
 * - **Dynamic Authorization**: Dynamic approval methods integrated with BasePolicy._hasPolicy() for consistent checking
 * - **Error Handling**: Consistent authorization failure handling with logging and administrative visibility
 * 
 * ### Workflow-Specific Authorization
 * Specialized authorization methods for recommendation workflow:
 * - **Note Management**: Private note access through canViewPrivateNotes() and canAddNote() authorization
 * - **Hidden Recommendations**: Administrative access to hidden recommendations through canViewHidden()
 * - **State Transitions**: Bulk state update authorization through canUpdateStates() with appropriate validation
 * - **Administrative Operations**: Comprehensive administrative access through permission-based authorization
 * 
 * ## Organizational Access Control
 * 
 * ### Branch-Based Authorization
 * Recommendation access controlled through organizational hierarchy:
 * - **Branch Scoping**: Recommendation entity access limited to authorized branch contexts through getBranchId() validation
 * - **Organizational Access**: Multi-branch recommendation management for administrative users and cross-branch operations
 * - **Administrative Override**: Global permissions support cross-branch recommendation management for system coordination
 * - **Data Isolation**: Branch-based data isolation ensuring organizational security and appropriate access control
 * 
 * ### Member Context Authorization
 * Sophisticated member-based access control:
 * - **Requester Validation**: Recommendation access for submitting members through identity-based authorization
 * - **Subject Authorization**: Access control for members being recommended with appropriate privacy protection
 * - **Administrative Access**: Administrative recommendation access with comprehensive oversight and validation
 * - **Privacy Protection**: Member-specific authorization respecting privacy requirements and organizational policies
 * 
 * ## Security Architecture
 * 
 * ### Access Control Implementation
 * The policy implements multi-layer security through comprehensive authorization:
 * - **Authentication Required**: All operations require authenticated user identity through KmpIdentityInterface validation
 * - **Permission Validation**: Recommendation operations validated against comprehensive RBAC permissions and authority
 * - **Workflow Security**: State transition authorization through workflow-aware permission checking and validation
 * - **Administrative Protection**: Administrative operations secured through appropriate permission requirements and oversight
 * 
 * ### Dynamic Security Features
 * Advanced security implementation for dynamic authorization:
 * - **Level-Based Security**: Approval authority validated against specific award levels and permission requirements
 * - **Dynamic Validation**: Dynamic method authorization through magic method integration and permission checking
 * - **Workflow Integrity**: State machine authorization maintaining workflow integrity and business rule compliance
 * - **Audit Integration**: Authorization decisions logged for compliance monitoring and administrative review
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ### Controller Integration
 * ```php
 * // RecommendationsController with workflow authorization
 * public function view($id) {
 *     $recommendation = $this->Recommendations->get($id);
 *     $this->Authorization->authorize($recommendation); // Uses canView() delegation
 *     $this->set(compact('recommendation'));
 * }
 * 
 * public function updateStates() {
 *     $recommendations = $this->request->getData('recommendations');
 *     foreach ($recommendations as $recData) {
 *         $recommendation = $this->Recommendations->get($recData['id']);
 *         $this->Authorization->authorize($recommendation, 'updateStates');
 *         // State update processing...
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Dynamic Approval Authorization

 * // Dynamic level-based approval checking
 * public function processApproval($recommendationId, $newState) {
 *     $recommendation = $this->Recommendations->get($recommendationId, [
 *         'contain' => ['Awards.Levels']
 *     ]);
 *     
 *     $levelName = $recommendation->award->level->name;
 *     $approvalMethod = 'canApproveLevel' . $levelName;
 *     
 *     if (!$this->Authorization->can($recommendation, $approvalMethod)) {
 *         throw new ForbiddenException('Not authorized to approve this level');
 *     }
 *     
 *     // Process approval...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Member-Specific Access

     *
     * ## Authorization Logic
     *
     * The method implements two-tier authorization:

     *
     * ## Member Context Validation
     *
     * Member identity validation ensures appropriate access:
     * - **Requester Identity**: User identity compared against recommendation requester_id for direct access
     * - **Privacy Protection**: Non-requester access controlled through permission-based authorization
     * - **Administrative Access**: Administrative users can access through appropriate permissions
     * - **Audit Integration**: Access decisions logged for compliance and administrative oversight
     *

     * - **Warrant Validation**: Dynamic approval authority validated through warrant-based permission checking
     * - **Administrative Authority**: Level approval permissions support administrative oversight and management
     * - **Audit Integration**: Dynamic authorization decisions logged for compliance and administrative review

    /**
     * Returns names of dynamically generated methods based on award level names
     *
     * This method provides policy introspection capabilities by returning a list of all
     * dynamically available authorization methods based on current award levels in the system.
     * This supports policy discovery, administrative interfaces, and automated authorization
     * testing while maintaining synchronization with award level configuration.
     *
     * ## Dynamic Method Discovery
     *
     * Method discovery through award level integration:
     * - **Level Integration**: Award levels discovered from LevelsTable for dynamic method generation
     * - **Method Generation**: canApproveLevel* methods generated for each active award level
     * - **Policy Introspection**: Method list supports policy discovery and administrative interfaces
     * - **System Synchronization**: Dynamic methods automatically updated when award levels change
     *
     * ## Administrative Integration
     *
     * Method discovery supporting administrative interfaces:
     * - **Permission Management**: Method list supports permission configuration and administrative setup
     * - **Role Assignment**: Dynamic methods enable role-based approval authority assignment
     * - **System Documentation**: Method discovery supports automated documentation and system analysis
     * - **Testing Integration**: Method list enables comprehensive authorization testing and validation
     *
     * @return array List of dynamic method names for level-specific approval authorization
     *
     * @example Policy Introspection
     * ```php
     * // Discover available approval methods
     * $availableMethods = RecommendationPolicy::getDynamicMethods();
     * // Returns: ['canApproveLevelAoA', 'canApproveLevelGoA', 'canApproveLevelPeerage', ...]
     * 
     * foreach ($availableMethods as $method) {
     *     echo "Available approval method: {$method}\n";
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * @example Administrative Permission Setup
     * ```php
     * // Configure permissions for all approval levels
     * public function setupApprovalPermissions() {
     *     $methods = RecommendationPolicy::getDynamicMethods();
     *     
     *     foreach ($methods as $method) {
