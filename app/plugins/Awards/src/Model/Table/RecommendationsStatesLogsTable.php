/**
 * Awards Recommendations States Logs Table - Audit Trail Management and State Transition Logging
 * 
 * The RecommendationsStatesLogsTable class provides comprehensive audit trail management for
 * recommendation state transitions within the Awards plugin, implementing detailed state change
 * logging, accountability tracking, and timeline management. This table serves as a critical
 * component for maintaining comprehensive audit trails, compliance monitoring, and administrative
 * oversight of recommendation workflow processing.
 * 
 * ## Audit Trail Architecture
 * 
 * The RecommendationsStatesLogsTable implements a comprehensive audit trail system:
 * - State transition logging with before/after state tracking
 * - User accountability through creation tracking and administrative oversight
 * - Timeline management with automatic timestamp recording for audit compliance
 * - Comprehensive logging for workflow analytics and administrative reporting
 * 
 * ## State Transition Logging
 * 
 * ### State Change Tracking
 * - From/to state recording for complete transition visibility
 * - From/to status tracking for comprehensive workflow state management
 * - User attribution for accountability and administrative oversight
 * - Automatic creation through RecommendationsTable afterSave() integration
 * 
 * ### Timeline Management
 * - Timestamp recording for temporal audit trail and compliance tracking
 * - Chronological state change history for workflow analytics
 * - Administrative timeline visibility for oversight and compliance monitoring
 * - Integration with reporting systems for audit trail analysis and documentation
 * 
 * ## Association Architecture
 * 
 * The table establishes critical relationships within the Awards plugin ecosystem:
 * 
 * ### Recommendation Association (belongsTo)
 * - **Purpose**: Links state logs to specific recommendations for audit trail management
 * - **Foreign Key**: `recommendation_id` with INNER join requirement for audit integrity
 * - **Class**: Awards.Recommendations entity for recommendation workflow integration
 * - **Usage**: Enables comprehensive recommendation state history and audit trail tracking
 * 
 * ## Accountability Features
 * 
 * ### User Tracking
 * - Creation user recording for accountability and administrative oversight
 * - Integration with user management for audit trail attribution
 * - Administrative visibility for compliance monitoring and oversight
 * - Support for audit reporting and accountability tracking systems
 * 
 * ### Administrative Oversight
 * - Comprehensive state change visibility for administrative monitoring
 * - Audit trail support for compliance and regulatory requirements
 * - Timeline tracking for workflow analytics and performance monitoring
 * - Integration with administrative reporting and oversight capabilities
 * 
 * ## Behavior Integration
 * 
 * The table incorporates essential CakePHP behaviors for audit trail functionality:
 * - **Timestamp Behavior**: Automatic creation timestamp recording for audit timeline
 * - **Note**: No modification timestamps needed as state logs are immutable audit records
 * - **Note**: No soft deletion as audit records require permanent retention for compliance
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ### Automatic State Logging
 * ```php
 * // Automatic logging through RecommendationsTable integration
 * $recommendationsTable = TableRegistry::getTableLocator()->get('Awards.Recommendations');
 * $recommendation = $recommendationsTable->get($recommendationId);
 * 
 * // Set before state for logging
 * $recommendation->beforeState = $recommendation->state;
 * $recommendation->beforeStatus = $recommendation->status;
 * 
 * // Update state triggers automatic logging
 * $recommendation = $recommendationsTable->patchEntity($recommendation, [
 *     'state' => 'approved',
 *     'status' => 'approved',
 *     'modified_by' => $userId
 * ]);
 * 
 * $recommendationsTable->save($recommendation); // Triggers logStateChange()
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Audit Trail Queries
 * ```php
 * // Get complete state history for recommendation
 * $stateLogsTable = TableRegistry::getTableLocator()->get('Awards.RecommendationsStatesLogs');
 * $stateHistory = $stateLogsTable->find()
 *     ->where(['recommendation_id' => $recommendationId])
 *     ->orderBy(['created' => 'ASC'])
 *     ->toArray();
 * 
 * // Recent state changes across all recommendations
 * $recentChanges = $stateLogsTable->find()
 *     ->contain(['AwardsRecommendations'])
 *     ->where(['created >=' => date('Y-m-d', strtotime('-7 days'))])
 *     ->orderBy(['created' => 'DESC'])
 *     ->toArray();
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Administrative Reporting
 * ```php
 * // State transition analytics
 * $transitionCounts = $stateLogsTable->find()
 *     ->select([
 *         'from_state',
 *         'to_state',
 *         'count' => $stateLogsTable->find()->func()->count('*')
 *     ])
 *     ->group(['from_state', 'to_state'])
 *     ->toArray();
 * 
 * // User activity audit trail
 * $userActivity = $stateLogsTable->find()
 *     ->where(['created_by' => $userId])
 *     ->contain(['AwardsRecommendations'])
 *     ->orderBy(['created' => 'DESC'])
 *     ->limit(50)
 *     ->toArray();
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Compliance Monitoring
 * ```php
 * // Find recommendations with specific state transitions
 * $approvedRecommendations = $stateLogsTable->find()
 *     ->where([
 *         'to_state' => 'approved',
 *         'created >=' => $reportStartDate,
 *         'created <=' => $reportEndDate
 *     ])
 *     ->contain(['AwardsRecommendations.Awards'])
 *     ->toArray();
 * ```
