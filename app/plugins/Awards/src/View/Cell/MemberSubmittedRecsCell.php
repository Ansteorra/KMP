/**
 * Member Submitted Recommendations View Cell
 * 
 * Provides comprehensive recommendation dashboard functionality for displaying award recommendations
 * submitted by a member with submission tracking, status visualization, and member profile integration.
 * This view cell implements dashboard features for member profile contexts and administrative oversight.
 * 
 * The view cell integrates with the Awards plugin recommendation system to provide member-specific
 * recommendation display with submission history, workflow progress tracking, and administrative
 * management capabilities. It implements permission-aware display logic and identity management
 * for secure recommendation access.
 * 
 * ## Dashboard Features
 * 
 * The view cell provides comprehensive dashboard functionality:
 * - **Submitted Recommendations**: Display of award recommendations submitted by the member
 * - **Status Tracking**: Visual representation of recommendation workflow status and progress
 * - **Workflow Progress**: Integration with recommendation state machine for progress visualization
 * - **Administrative Oversight**: Support for administrative viewing of member submissions
 * 
 * ## Member Context Support
 * 
 * The view cell implements sophisticated member context handling:
 * - **Profile Integration**: Seamless integration with member profile views and navigation
 * - **Submission History**: Complete history of member's recommendation submissions
 * - **Administrative Management**: Administrative access to member submission oversight
 * - **Identity Validation**: Secure identity management with permission-based access control
 * 
 * ## Permission Integration
 * 
 * The view cell implements comprehensive permission checking:
 * - **Self-Access**: Members can always view their own submitted recommendations
 * - **Administrative Access**: Users with `view` permissions on `Awards.Recommendations` can view others' submissions
 * - **Identity Management**: Supports both specific member ID and current user (-1) contexts
 * - **Security Enforcement**: Returns early with no display for unauthorized access attempts
 * 
 * ## Turbo Frame Integration
 * 
 * The view cell leverages Turbo Frames for dynamic content loading:
 * - **Lazy Loading**: Recommendations are loaded asynchronously for better performance
 * - **Dynamic Updates**: Content updates without full page refresh for better user experience
 * - **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful fallback for environments without Turbo support
 * - **URL Generation**: Dynamic URL construction for filtered recommendation display
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ### Member Profile Integration
 * ```php
 * // In member profile templates
 * echo $this->cell('Awards.MemberSubmittedRecs', [$member->id]);
 * 
 * // For current user profile
 * echo $this->cell('Awards.MemberSubmittedRecs', [-1]);
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Administrative Views
 * ```php
 * // In administrative member management
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($user, 'view', 'Awards.Recommendations')) {
 *     echo $this->cell('Awards.MemberSubmittedRecs', [$memberId]);
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Dashboard Integration
 * ```php
 * // In dashboard widgets
 * $submittedRecsWidget = $this->cell('Awards.MemberSubmittedRecs', [
 *     $currentUser->id
 * ]);
 * 
 * // With tab integration through ViewCellProvider
 * $tabs[] = [
 *     'label' => 'Submitted Award Recs.',
 *     'content' => $this->cell('Awards.MemberSubmittedRecs', [$memberId])
 * ];
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Template Integration
 * 
 * The view cell template provides:
 * - **Action Button**: Quick access to submit new award recommendations
 * - **Conditional Display**: Shows Turbo Frame for recommendations or "No Award Recs" message
 * - **URL Construction**: Dynamic URL building for filtered recommendation table view
 * - **Lazy Loading**: Turbo Frame with lazy loading for performance optimization

    /**
     * Display member submitted recommendations with dashboard functionality
     *
     * Renders the member submitted recommendations view cell with comprehensive dashboard
     * functionality, permission-aware access control, and identity management. The method
     * implements secure recommendation access validation and provides submission tracking
     * for both self-access and administrative oversight scenarios.
     * 
     * The display process:
     * 1. **Identity Resolution**: Resolves member ID (-1 for current user, specific ID for others)
     * 2. **Permission Validation**: Checks user permissions for viewing recommendation submissions
     * 3. **Authorization Enforcement**: Ensures users can only view authorized recommendation data
     * 4. **Data Preparation**: Queries recommendation count to determine display state
     * 5. **Template Variables**: Sets template variables for conditional display logic
     * 
     * ## Permission Logic
     * 
     * The method implements sophisticated permission checking:
     * - **Self-Access**: Users always have access to their own submitted recommendations
     * - **Administrative Access**: Users with `view` permissions on `Awards.Recommendations` can view others
     * - **Security Enforcement**: Returns early with no display for unauthorized access
     * - **Identity Protection**: Validates user identity before allowing data access
     * 
     * ## Data Management
     * 
     * The method performs efficient data querying:
     * - **Count Query**: Uses count() for efficient existence checking without loading full data
     * - **Filtered Query**: Queries recommendations by requester_id for member-specific display
     * - **Lazy Loading**: Actual recommendation data loaded by Turbo Frame in template
     * - **Performance Optimization**: Minimal initial data loading for responsive display
     * 
     * ## Template Variables
     * 
     * Sets the following variables for template rendering:
     * - **$isEmpty**: Boolean indicating whether member has submitted any recommendations
     * - **$id**: Member ID for URL construction and data filtering in template
     * 
     * ## Security Considerations
     * 
     * - **Early Return**: Returns immediately for unauthorized access without exposing data
     * - **Permission Checking**: Uses checkCan() method for proper authorization validation
     * - **Identity Validation**: Ensures user identity is properly authenticated
     * - **Data Scoping**: Filters data by requester_id to prevent data leakage
     *
     * @param int $id Member ID to display recommendations for (-1 for current user)
     * @return void Sets template variables or returns early for unauthorized access
     * 
     * @example
     * ```php
     * // Display current user's submitted recommendations
     * $this->cell('Awards.MemberSubmittedRecs', [-1]);
     * 
     * // Display specific member's recommendations (with permission check)
     * $this->cell('Awards.MemberSubmittedRecs', [$memberId]);
     * ```
