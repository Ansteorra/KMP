/**
 * Recommendations For Member View Cell
 * 
 * Provides comprehensive member-specific recommendation display with eligibility tracking,
 * member profile integration, and administrative oversight. This view cell implements
 * recommendation discovery for members with member context validation and eligibility
 * assessment capabilities.
 * 
 * The view cell integrates with the Awards plugin recommendation system to provide
 * member-focused recommendation display with recommendation history tracking, current
 * submission management, and administrative member scope visualization.
 * 
 * ## Member Context Management
 * 
 * The view cell implements sophisticated member context handling:
 * - **Recommendation Discovery**: Displays award recommendations received by the specified member
 * - **Member Profile Integration**: Seamless integration with member profile views and navigation
 * - **Eligibility Assessment**: Context for evaluating member's recommendation history and eligibility
 * - **Relationship Validation**: Ensures appropriate access based on user-member relationships
 * 
 * ## Administrative Features
 * 
 * The view cell provides administrative oversight capabilities:
 * - **Member Scope Visualization**: Administrative view of member's received recommendations
 * - **Recommendation Management**: Administrative access to member recommendation oversight
 * - **Historical Tracking**: Complete history of recommendations received by the member
 * - **Administrative Context**: Support for administrative member management workflows
 * 
 * ## Permission Integration
 * 
 * The view cell implements comprehensive permission and relationship checking:
 * - **Self-Exclusion**: Members cannot view recommendations received about themselves (privacy protection)
 * - **Administrative Access**: Users with `view` permissions on `Awards.Recommendations` can view others' received recommendations
 * - **Identity Management**: Supports both specific member ID and current user (-1) contexts
 * - **Privacy Protection**: Enforces privacy rules for recommendation visibility
 * 
 * ## Relationship Logic
 * 
 * The view cell implements sophisticated relationship-based access:
 * - **Own Profile Exclusion**: Users viewing their own profile cannot see received recommendations
 * - **Third-Party Viewing**: Users can view recommendations received by other members (with permissions)
 * - **Administrative Override**: Administrative users can view all member recommendation data
 * - **Context Awareness**: Different behavior based on viewer-viewed member relationship
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ### Member Profile Views
 * ```php
 * // In member profile templates (viewing another member)
 * if ($currentUser->id !== $member->id) {
 *     echo $this->cell('Awards.RecsForMember', [$member->id]);
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Administrative Management
 * ```php
 * // In administrative member oversight
 * if ($this->Authorization->can($user, 'view', 'Awards.Recommendations')) {
 *     echo $this->cell('Awards.RecsForMember', [$memberId]);
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Recommendation Tracking
 * ```php
 * // For tracking member's received recommendations
 * $receivedRecsWidget = $this->cell('Awards.RecsForMember', [
 *     $targetMemberId
 * ]);
 * 
 * // With conditional display based on relationship
 * if ($viewerUserId !== $targetUserId) {
 *     echo $this->cell('Awards.RecsForMember', [$targetUserId]);
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Template Integration
 * 
 * The view cell template provides:
 * - **Conditional Display**: Shows Turbo Frame for recommendations or "No Award Recs" message
 * - **URL Construction**: Dynamic URL building for filtered recommendation table view
 * - **Lazy Loading**: Turbo Frame with lazy loading for performance optimization
 * - **Member-Specific Filtering**: URLs filtered by member_id for targeted recommendation display
 * 
 * ## Business Logic Considerations
 * 
 * - **Privacy Protection**: Implements privacy rules for recommendation visibility
 * - **Administrative Workflow**: Supports administrative member management and oversight
 * - **Data Integrity**: Ensures proper member context and relationship validation
 * - **Performance Optimization**: Uses efficient count queries for display state determination

    /**
     * Display recommendations received by a member with relationship-aware access control
     *
     * Renders the recommendations for member view cell with comprehensive member context
     * validation, privacy protection, and administrative oversight capabilities. The method
     * implements sophisticated relationship-based access control and member-specific
     * recommendation discovery with eligibility assessment.
     * 
     * The display process:
     * 1. **Identity Resolution**: Resolves member ID (-1 for current user, specific ID for others)
     * 2. **Relationship Validation**: Checks viewer-viewed member relationship for privacy protection
     * 3. **Permission Enforcement**: Validates administrative access for viewing others' received recommendations
     * 4. **Privacy Protection**: Prevents users from viewing recommendations they received about themselves
     * 5. **Data Preparation**: Queries recommendation count for member-specific display
     * 6. **Template Variables**: Sets variables for conditional display and URL construction
     * 
     * ## Privacy and Relationship Logic
     * 
     * The method implements sophisticated privacy protection:
     * - **Self-Exclusion**: Users cannot view recommendations received about themselves
     * - **Third-Party Access**: Users can view recommendations received by others (with permissions)
     * - **Administrative Override**: Users with proper permissions can view all recommendation data
     * - **Context-Aware Display**: Different behavior based on viewer-viewed member relationship
     * 
     * ## Permission Validation
     * 
     * The method performs comprehensive permission checking:
     * - **Identity Matching**: Checks if current user is viewing their own profile
     * - **Administrative Access**: Validates `view` permissions on `Awards.Recommendations`
     * - **Early Return**: Returns with empty state for unauthorized or self-viewing scenarios
     * - **Security Enforcement**: Ensures privacy rules are strictly enforced
     * 
     * ## Data Management
     * 
     * The method performs efficient member-specific data querying:
     * - **Member-Filtered Query**: Queries recommendations by member_id (subject of recommendation)
     * - **Count Optimization**: Uses count() for efficient existence checking
     * - **Lazy Loading**: Actual recommendation data loaded by Turbo Frame in template
     * - **Performance Focus**: Minimal initial data loading for responsive display
     * 
     * ## Template Variables
     * 
     * Sets the following variables for template rendering:
     * - **$isEmpty**: Boolean indicating whether member has received any recommendations
     * - **$id**: Member ID for URL construction and data filtering in template
     * 
     * ## Security and Privacy Considerations
     * 
     * - **Privacy Enforcement**: Strict enforcement of privacy rules for recommendation visibility
     * - **Relationship Validation**: Ensures appropriate viewer-viewed member relationships
     * - **Permission Checking**: Uses checkCan() method for proper authorization validation
     * - **Data Scoping**: Filters data by member_id to prevent unauthorized data access
     * - **Early Return**: Returns with safe state for unauthorized or inappropriate access
     *
     * @param int $id Member ID to display received recommendations for (-1 for current user)
     * @return void Sets template variables or returns early for unauthorized/inappropriate access
     * 
     * @example
     * ```php
     * // Display recommendations received by another member
     * if ($currentUser->id !== $targetMember->id) {
     *     $this->cell('Awards.RecsForMember', [$targetMember->id]);
     * }
     * 
     * // Administrative view of member's received recommendations
     * if ($this->Authorization->can($user, 'view', 'Awards.Recommendations')) {
     *     $this->cell('Awards.RecsForMember', [$memberId]);
     * }
     * ```
