/**
 * Awards Plugin AppController - Base Controller for Award Management System
 * 
 * Provides the foundational security architecture and component management for all
 * controllers within the Awards plugin. This base controller establishes the
 * security baseline, component loading patterns, and architectural integration
 * that supports the comprehensive award recommendation workflow management system.
 * 
 * The Awards AppController extends the main KMP application controller to inherit
 * core security features while adding Awards-specific component configuration
 * and integration patterns. This ensures consistent security implementation
 * across all award management interfaces and recommendation workflows.
 * 
 * ## Core Security Architecture:
 * - **Authentication Integration**: Seamless user authentication for award access
 * - **Authorization Framework**: Permission-based access control for award operations
 * - **Component Loading**: Standardized component initialization for Awards functionality
 * - **Security Baseline**: Consistent security patterns across all Awards controllers
 * 
 * ## Component Integration:
 * The controller loads essential components for Awards plugin functionality:
 * - **Authentication**: User identity verification and session management
 * - **Authorization**: Policy-based access control for recommendation workflows
 * - **Flash Messaging**: Standardized user feedback across award operations
 * 
 * ## Plugin Architecture:
 * This base controller provides the foundation for all Awards plugin controllers,
 * ensuring consistent security implementation, component availability, and
 * integration with the broader KMP application architecture. All award-specific
 * controllers inherit from this base to maintain security and functionality consistency.
 * 
 * ## Usage Patterns:
 * Controllers extending this base automatically inherit:
 * - Authentication and authorization component access
 * - Flash messaging capabilities for user feedback
 * - Security baseline configuration for award operations
 * - Integration with KMP application security framework

    /**
     * Initialize Awards Plugin Base Controller - Security and component configuration
     * 
     * Performs comprehensive initialization of the Awards plugin base controller,
     * establishing the security framework and component loading patterns required
     * for award recommendation management functionality. This initialization ensures
     * that all Awards plugin controllers have consistent access to authentication,
     * authorization, and user feedback capabilities.
     * 
     * ## Component Loading Strategy:
     * The initialization loads essential components in a specific order to ensure
     * proper dependency resolution and security framework establishment:
     * 
     * 1. **Parent Initialization**: Inherits core KMP application controller setup
     * 2. **Authentication Component**: Establishes user identity verification
     * 3. **Authorization Component**: Enables policy-based access control
     * 4. **Flash Component**: Provides standardized user feedback messaging
     * 
     * ## Security Configuration:
     * The component loading establishes the security baseline for all Awards
     * plugin operations, ensuring that recommendation workflows, award management,
     * and administrative operations are properly protected through the KMP
     * security framework integration.
     * 
     * ## Integration Points:
     * This initialization integrates with:
     * - **KMP Security Framework**: Authentication and authorization systems
     * - **Award Recommendation Workflows**: Security context for workflow operations
     * - **Administrative Interfaces**: Access control for award management
     * - **User Feedback Systems**: Consistent messaging across Awards functionality
