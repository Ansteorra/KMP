/**
 * Award Events Management Controller
 *
 * Provides comprehensive event management functionality for the Awards plugin,
 * handling temporal event management and award ceremony coordination. Events
 * serve as the temporal framework for award recommendation processing and
 * ceremony organization within the hierarchical award system.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 * - **Event Lifecycle**: Complete CRUD operations for award event management
 * - **Temporal Management**: Event scheduling with start/end dates and status management
 * - **Ceremony Coordination**: Integration with recommendation workflows and award ceremonies
 * - **State Management**: Event open/closed status with recommendation integration
 * - **Security Framework**: Entity-level authorization with policy-based access control
 * - **Audit Trail**: Soft deletion pattern with recommendation state management
 *
 * ## Event Structure
 * Events provide temporal framework for award processing and ceremony coordination:
 * ```
 * Event (temporal award processing framework)
 *   ├── start_date (event opening for recommendations)
 *   ├── end_date (event closing for recommendations)
 *   ├── closed (boolean status flag)
 *   ├── branch_id (organizational scope)
 *   └── Recommendations (associated award recommendations)
 *       ├── State Machine Integration
 *       └── Award Processing Workflow
 * ```
 *
 * ## Temporal Management
 * - **Event Scheduling**: Start and end date management for recommendation windows
 * - **Status Control**: Open/closed state management for recommendation processing
 * - **Branch Scoping**: Organizational scope limitation for events
 * - **Recommendation Integration**: Event-based recommendation workflow coordination
 *
 * ## Security Architecture
 * - **Model Authorization**: Automatic authorization for index and add operations
 * - **Entity Authorization**: Individual entity authorization for view, edit, delete
 * - **Policy Integration**: Awards plugin authorization policies control access
 * - **Administrative Control**: Permission-based event management oversight
 *
 * ## Usage Examples
 * ```php
 * // Create new award event with temporal validation
 * $eventsController = new EventsController();
 * $event = $eventsController->add(); // Creates event with date validation
 * 
 * // View event with recommendations
 * $event = $eventsController->view($eventId); // Includes recommendation data
 * 
 * // Administrative event management with state filtering
 * $events = $eventsController->allEvents('active'); // Filter by event status
 * ```
 *
 * ## Integration Points
 * - **RecommendationsTable**: Primary relationship for award recommendation processing
 * - **Authorization Framework**: Policy-based access control integration
 * - **Administrative Interface**: Full administrative management capabilities
 * - **Branch System**: Organizational scope integration and filtering
 * - **Navigation System**: Integration with Awards plugin navigation

     * Initialize Controller Components and Authorization
     *
     * Configures the EventsController with comprehensive security framework
     * integration and component management. Establishes authorization baseline
     * for event management operations with model-level access control and
     * temporal management integration.
     *
     * ## Security Configuration
     * - **Model Authorization**: Automatic authorization for index and add operations
     * - **Policy Integration**: Awards plugin authorization policies control access
     * - **Component Inheritance**: Inherits security framework from Awards AppController
     * - **Temporal Management**: Integration with event lifecycle and scheduling system
     *
     * ## Authorization Framework
     * The controller automatically authorizes common operations:
     * - `index`: Event listing with administrative access control and temporal filtering
     * - `add`: Event creation with administrative permission validation and temporal management
     * - Individual entity operations (view, edit, delete) require explicit authorization
     *
     * ## Component Configuration
     * Inherits from Awards AppController providing:
     * - Authentication component for user validation
     * - Authorization component with policy-based access control
     * - Flash component for standardized user feedback
     *

     * Basic Event Listing Index
     *
     * Provides basic event listing functionality. Currently placeholder
     * implementation with full functionality available through allEvents()
     * method which provides comprehensive event management with state filtering.
     *
     * ## Implementation Note
     * This method serves as a basic entry point but primary event listing
     * functionality is provided by the allEvents() method which offers:
     * - State-based filtering (active/closed)
     * - Temporal ordering and management
     * - Comprehensive authorization and scoping
     *
     * ## Security
     * - **Model Authorization**: Automatic authorization via initialize() method
     * - **Policy Control**: EventsTablePolicy governs access to event listing
     * - **Administrative Access**: Requires appropriate event management permissions
     *
     * ## Usage Examples
     * ```php
     * // Basic event listing
     * GET /awards/events
     * 
     * // For full functionality, use allEvents
     * GET /awards/events/allEvents/active

     * - **Temporal Ordering**: Events sorted by start_date for chronological display
     * - **Branch Scoping**: Organizational context with branch information
     *
     * ## Query Features
     * - **Optimized Associations**: Selective field loading for performance
     * - **Authorization Scoping**: Policy-based query filtering and access control
     * - **Pagination Support**: Configurable pagination for large event sets
     * - **Administrative Access**: Policy-controlled access to event listing
     *
     * ## Security Framework
     * - **Entity Authorization**: Security entity check for access validation
     * - **Authorization Scoping**: Policy-based query filtering via applyScope
     * - **State Validation**: Parameter validation to prevent invalid state access
     * - **Administrative Control**: Comprehensive access control and filtering

     * Handles complex recommendation state cleanup when events are deleted,
     * ensuring data integrity across the award recommendation system.
     *
     * ## Deletion Workflow
     * 1. **Request Validation**: Restrict to POST/DELETE methods for security
     * 2. **Entity Loading**: Retrieve event record for deletion processing
     * 3. **Authorization Check**: Entity-level authorization via policy
     * 4. **Soft Deletion**: Modify event name with audit prefix before deletion
     * 5. **Recommendation Cleanup**: Revert associated recommendations to initial state
     *
     * ## Recommendation State Management
     * Complex recommendation cleanup ensures system integrity:
     * ```php
     * // Revert recommendations to initial state
     * $revertState = Recommendation::getStates()[0];
     * $recs = $this->Events->RecommendationsToGive->find('all')

     *     $rec->state = $revertState;
     *     $this->Events->RecommendationsToGive->save($rec);
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ## Soft Deletion Pattern
     * - **Audit Trail**: Event name prefixed with "Deleted:" for administrative tracking
     * - **State Cleanup**: Associated recommendations reverted to initial state
     * - **Data Integrity**: Maintains referential integrity across award system
     * - **Recovery Information**: Audit trail enables administrative review
     *
     * ## Security Framework
     * - **HTTP Method Restriction**: Only POST/DELETE methods accepted
     * - **Entity Authorization**: Individual event authorization via EventPolicy
     * - **Administrative Control**: Policy-based deletion permissions
     * - **State Management Security**: Controlled recommendation state transitions
     *
     * ## User Feedback
     * - **Success Message**: Confirmation of successful event deletion with cleanup
     * - **Error Message**: Feedback for unexpected deletion failures
     * - **Navigation Strategy**: Appropriate redirects based on operation outcome
     *
     * ## Error Handling
     * - **Record Validation**: NotFoundException for invalid event IDs
     * - **Authorization Validation**: UnauthorizedException for unauthorized deletion
     * - **Operation Failures**: Comprehensive error feedback and recovery
     * - **State Management Errors**: Recommendation cleanup error handling
     *
     * ## Usage Examples
     * ```php
     * // Administrative event deletion with recommendation cleanup
     * DELETE /awards/events/delete/123
