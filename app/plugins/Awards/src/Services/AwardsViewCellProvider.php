/**
 * Awards View Cell Provider
 * 
 * Provides comprehensive view cell integration for the Awards plugin with multi-format support
 * and route-based visibility. This service manages view cell registration, integration contexts,
 * and ViewCellRegistry patterns for award recommendation display across member profiles and
 * administrative interfaces.
 * 
 * The view cell provider implements the plugin view cell architecture with context-aware
 * registration, route-based visibility, and multi-format support for various display contexts
 * including member profiles, administrative interfaces, and mobile API endpoints.
 * 
 * ## View Cell Architecture
 * 
 * The provider implements structured view cell registration:
 * - **Context-Aware Registration**: Registers view cells based on request context and user permissions
 * - **Route-Based Visibility**: Configures view cells with specific route requirements and visibility rules
 * - **Multi-Format Support**: Provides view cells for web interfaces, mobile APIs, and administrative contexts
 * - **Plugin Integration**: Coordinates with ViewCellRegistry for centralized view cell management
 * 
 * ## View Cell Types
 * 
 * The provider manages multiple view cell categories:
 * - **Member Recommendations**: Display of award recommendations associated with member profiles
 * - **Award Hierarchies**: Visualization of award structure and recommendation relationships
 * - **JSON API Endpoints**: Structured data provision for mobile applications and AJAX interfaces
 * - **Administrative Views**: Specialized view cells for administrative oversight and management
 * 
 * ## Integration Contexts
 * 
 * View cells are configured for multiple integration contexts:
 * - **Member Profiles**: Integration with member profile views for recommendation display
 * - **Award Management**: Administrative interfaces for award and recommendation management
 * - **Mobile API Support**: JSON endpoints for mobile application data consumption
 * - **Dashboard Integration**: Widget support for dashboard and summary displays
 * 
 * ## Performance Considerations
 * 
 * The provider implements performance optimization:
 * - **Plugin Availability Checking**: Early return for disabled plugins to avoid unnecessary processing
 * - **Lazy Loading Patterns**: View cells are registered but not instantiated until needed
 * - **Context Filtering**: Only relevant view cells are registered based on request context
 * - **Route Optimization**: Efficient route matching for view cell visibility determination
 * 
 * ## Usage Examples
 * 
 * ### Basic View Cell Registration
 * ```php
 * // In view cell registration services
 * $user = $this->getCurrentUser();
 * $urlParams = $this->request->getParam();
 * $viewCells = AwardsViewCellProvider::getViewCells($urlParams, $user);
 * 
 * foreach ($viewCells as $cellConfig) {
 *     ViewCellRegistry::register($cellConfig);
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Plugin Integration
 * ```php
 * // In main application view cell loading
 * if (StaticHelpers::pluginEnabled('Awards')) {
 *     $awardsCells = AwardsViewCellProvider::getViewCells($urlParams, $user);
 *     $this->mergeViewCells($awardsCells);
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### API Endpoint Integration
 * ```php
 * // For mobile API responses
 * $viewCells = AwardsViewCellProvider::getViewCells($urlParams, $user);
 * $jsonData = [];
 * 
 * foreach ($viewCells as $cell) {
 *     if ($cell['type'] === ViewCellRegistry::PLUGIN_TYPE_JSON) {
 *         $jsonData[$cell['id']] = $this->cell($cell['cell']);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Mobile Application Support
 * ```php
 * // Mobile app integration example
 * $mobileViewCells = array_filter($viewCells, function($cell) {
 *     return isset($cell['mobileSupport']) && $cell['mobileSupport'] === true;
 * });
 * 
 * $mobileResponse = [
 *     'member_recommendations' => $this->cell('Awards.MemberSubmittedRecs'),
 *     'received_recommendations' => $this->cell('Awards.RecsForMember')
 * ];
 * ```
