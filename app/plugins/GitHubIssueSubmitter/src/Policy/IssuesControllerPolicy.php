/**
 * Issues Controller Authorization Policy - Anonymous Submission Access Control
 *
 * This authorization policy governs access to the Issues controller within the
 * GitHubIssueSubmitter plugin, specifically designed to support anonymous feedback
 * submission while maintaining security framework integration. It implements a
 * permissive authorization model that allows public access to feedback submission
 * endpoints while preserving the ability to add administrative controls in the future.
 *
 * ## Authorization Architecture
 *
 * ### Anonymous Submission Support
 * The policy is designed to support the plugin's core functionality of anonymous
 * feedback collection:
 * - Allows unrestricted access to feedback submission endpoints
 * - Maintains integration with KMP's authorization framework
 * - Provides foundation for future access control enhancements
 * - Supports audit trail through GitHub issue tracking
 *
 * ### Security Framework Integration
 * - Extends BasePolicy for consistent authorization patterns
 * - Integrates with KMP's identity and permission systems
 * - Maintains compatibility with application-wide security policies
 * - Provides structured approach to access control decisions
 *
 * ### Permission Model Design
 * The policy implements a strategic permission model:
 * - **Current State**: Permissive access for anonymous feedback submission
 * - **Future Extensibility**: Framework for administrative controls and restrictions
 * - **Security Integration**: Maintains audit trail and security awareness
 * - **Abuse Prevention**: Foundation for implementing rate limiting and content filtering
 *
 * ## Controller Operations Governance
 *
 * ### Anonymous Submission Access
 * - **submit()**: Public access for all users (anonymous and authenticated)
 * - **Future Actions**: Framework ready for administrative endpoints
 * - **Access Control**: Consistent with plugin's anonymous feedback mission
 *
 * ### Administrative Operations
 * While not currently implemented, the policy provides foundation for:
 * - Administrative feedback review and management
 * - Submission statistics and analytics
 * - Configuration management and settings
 * - User feedback moderation and filtering
 *
 * ## Security Implementation
 *
 * ### Anonymous Submission Safety
 * - Open access model supports anonymous feedback collection
 * - Security maintained through other layers (input validation, API tokens)
 * - Audit trail preserved through GitHub issue creation
 * - Abuse prevention should be implemented at infrastructure level
 *
 * ### Data Protection
 * - No personal information collection or authorization requirements
 * - Submission tracking only through GitHub issue system
 * - Privacy maintained through anonymous submission process
 * - Content validation handled at controller level
 *
 * ### Abuse Prevention Framework
 * The policy provides foundation for implementing:
 * - Rate limiting based on IP address or session
 * - Content filtering and validation rules
 * - Temporary access restrictions for abuse mitigation
 * - Administrative override capabilities for emergency response
 *
 * ## Integration with Authorization Framework
 *
 * ### BasePolicy Inheritance
 * - Extends App\Policy\BasePolicy for consistent behavior
 * - Inherits standard authorization patterns and utilities
 * - Maintains compatibility with application-wide policy architecture
 * - Provides access to permission loading and validation utilities
 *
 * ### KmpIdentityInterface Integration
 * - Supports both authenticated and anonymous users
 * - Maintains compatibility with KMP's identity system
 * - Provides foundation for user-specific permissions in future
 * - Enables audit trail and user tracking capabilities
 *
 * ## Usage Examples
 *
 * ### Anonymous Access Verification
 * ```php
 * // Policy automatically allows anonymous submission
 * $canSubmit = $policy->canSubmit($anonymousUser, $request);
 * // Returns: true (allows anonymous feedback submission)
 * ```
 *
 * ### Controller Integration
 * ```php
 * // In IssuesController
 * public function submit() {
 *     // Policy check (currently always passes)
 *     $this->Authorization->authorize($this->request, 'submit');
 *     
 *     // Process submission...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Future Administrative Controls
 * ```php
 * // Example future administrative method
 * public function canManage(KmpIdentityInterface $user, mixed $resource): bool {
 *     return $this->hasPermission($user, 'GitHub.Issues.Manage');
 * }
 * 
 * public function canViewStatistics(KmpIdentityInterface $user, mixed $resource): bool {
 *     return $this->hasPermission($user, 'GitHub.Statistics.View');
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Future Enhancement Considerations
 *
 * ### Administrative Access Controls
 * Potential future enhancements include:
 * - Administrative review of submitted feedback
 * - Configuration management for GitHub settings
 * - Submission analytics and reporting
 * - Content moderation and filtering capabilities
 *
 * ### Abuse Prevention Measures
 * - IP-based rate limiting integration
 * - Content validation and filtering rules
 * - Temporary access restrictions for abuse cases
 * - Administrative override and emergency controls
 *
 * ### User Experience Enhancements
 * - Optional user identification for follow-up
 * - Submission tracking and status updates
 * - User feedback and satisfaction metrics
 * - Integration with user preference systems

{
    /**
     * Authorize anonymous feedback submission access
     *
     * This method implements the core authorization logic for anonymous feedback submission,
     * providing unrestricted access to support the plugin's mission of collecting public
     * feedback without authentication barriers. It maintains integration with KMP's
     * authorization framework while enabling anonymous user participation.
     *
     * ## Anonymous Access Control Strategy
     *
     * ### Permissive Access Model
     * The method implements a strategic permissive access approach:
     * - **Universal Access**: All users (anonymous and authenticated) can submit feedback
     * - **Security Through Other Layers**: Security maintained via input validation and API tokens
     * - **Future Enhancement Ready**: Framework prepared for additional restrictions if needed
     * - **Audit Trail Preservation**: Submissions tracked through GitHub issue creation
     *
     * ### Security Validation Framework
     * While currently permissive, the method provides foundation for:
     * - Rate limiting based on user session or IP address
     * - Content validation and filtering rules
     * - Temporary access restrictions for abuse mitigation
     * - Administrative emergency controls and overrides
     *
     * ## Integration with Authorization Architecture
     *
     * ### Framework Compliance
     * - Maintains consistency with KMP's authorization patterns
     * - Supports both ResultInterface and boolean return values
     * - Integrates with policy-based access control architecture
     * - Provides structured approach to permission decisions
     *
     * ### Identity Management
     * - Accepts KmpIdentityInterface for user identification
     * - Supports anonymous users (null identity)
     * - Enables future user-specific permission logic
     * - Maintains compatibility with application-wide identity system
     *
     * ## Anonymous Submission Security
     *
     * ### Multi-Layer Security Approach
     * Security is maintained through complementary mechanisms:
     * - **Input Validation**: Controller-level sanitization and validation
     * - **API Security**: GitHub token authentication and secure transmission
     * - **Infrastructure Security**: Rate limiting and DDoS protection at web server level
     * - **Content Security**: XSS prevention and malicious content filtering
     *
     * ### Abuse Prevention Strategy
     * - Open access balanced with infrastructure-level protections
     * - GitHub issue tracking provides audit trail and accountability
     * - Policy framework ready for implementing restrictions if abuse occurs
     * - Administrative capabilities available for emergency response
     *
     * ## Usage Patterns and Examples
     *
     * ### Standard Authorization Check
     * ```php
     * // In IssuesController::submit()
     * if (!$this->Authorization->can($this->request, 'submit')) {
     *     throw new ForbiddenException();
     * }
     * // Currently always passes, enabling anonymous submission
     * ```
     *
     * ### Anonymous User Handling
     * ```php
     * // Policy handles anonymous users gracefully
     * $anonymousUser = null; // Anonymous user identity
     * $canSubmit = $policy->canSubmit($anonymousUser, $request);
     * // Returns: true (anonymous submission allowed)
     * ```
     *
     * ### Future Enhancement Examples
     * ```php
     * // Example rate limiting integration
     * public function canSubmit(KmpIdentityInterface $user, mixed $resource): bool {
     *     // Check for rate limiting flags
     *     if ($this->isRateLimited($user, $resource)) {
     *         return $this->createResult(false, 'Rate limit exceeded');
     *     }
     *     
     *     // Check for content restrictions
     *     if ($this->hasContentRestrictions($resource)) {
     *         return $this->createResult(false, 'Content restrictions apply');
     *     }
     *     
     *     return true;
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ## Return Value Strategy
     *
     * ### Current Implementation
     * - Returns `true` for all requests to enable anonymous submission
     * - Maintains compatibility with authorization framework expectations
     * - Provides consistent behavior across all user types
     * - Supports future enhancement without breaking changes
     *
     * ### Future Enhancement Options
     * - `ResultInterface` for detailed authorization results with messages
     * - Boolean `false` for specific restriction scenarios
     * - Conditional logic based on user attributes or request context
     * - Integration with external validation services or APIs
     *
     * @param \App\KMP\KmpIdentityInterface|null $user User identity (null for anonymous users)
     * @param mixed $resource Request resource or context information
     * @return \Authorization\Policy\ResultInterface|bool Authorization result - currently always true
     * 
     * @example Anonymous Submission Authorization
     * ```php
     * // Anonymous user submitting feedback
     * $result = $policy->canSubmit(null, $submissionRequest);
     * if ($result === true) {
     *     // Process anonymous submission
     *     $this->processAnonymousSubmission($submissionRequest);
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * @example Future Rate Limiting Integration
     * ```php
     * // Example enhanced authorization with rate limiting
     * public function canSubmit(KmpIdentityInterface $user, mixed $resource): ResultInterface {
     *     $sessionId = $resource['session_id'] ?? null;
     *     $ipAddress = $resource['ip_address'] ?? null;
     *     
     *     if ($this->exceedsRateLimit($sessionId, $ipAddress)) {
     *         return $this->createResult(false, 'Submission rate limit exceeded');
     *     }
     *     
     *     return $this->createResult(true, 'Submission authorized');
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * @example Administrative Override Integration
     * ```php
     * // Example emergency restriction capability
     * public function canSubmit(KmpIdentityInterface $user, mixed $resource): bool {
     *     // Check for emergency restrictions
     *     if (StaticHelpers::getAppSetting('GitHub.Emergency.Disable', false)) {
     *         // Only allow admin users during emergency
     *         return $this->hasPermission($user, 'GitHub.Emergency.Submit');
     *     }
     *     
     *     return true; // Normal operation
     * }
     * ```
     */
    public function canSubmit(
        KmpIdentityInterface $user,
        mixed $resource,
    ): ResultInterface|bool {
        return true;
    }
}
