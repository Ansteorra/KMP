/**
 * GitHubIssueSubmitter Plugin AppController - Foundational Security and Component Management
 *
 * This class serves as the base controller for all GitHubIssueSubmitter plugin controllers,
 * providing foundational security architecture, component management, and integration patterns
 * specifically designed for anonymous feedback submission workflows. It extends the main KMP
 * application's AppController to maintain consistency while adding plugin-specific functionality.
 *
 * ## Security Architecture
 *
 * ### Anonymous Submission Security Baseline
 * The plugin AppController establishes a secure baseline for anonymous feedback submission:
 * - Inherits KMP's comprehensive security framework from BaseController
 * - Maintains CSRF protection for form submissions while allowing anonymous access
 * - Implements rate limiting awareness for abuse prevention
 * - Provides secure session management for anonymous user workflows
 *
 * ### Component Loading Strategy
 * - **Authentication Component**: Configured for anonymous submission bypass
 * - **Authorization Component**: Set up with plugin-specific policies for anonymous access
 * - **Flash Component**: Integrated for standardized user feedback across workflows
 * - **Security Component**: Maintains input sanitization and XSS protection
 *
 * ## Architectural Integration
 *
 * ### KMP Application Integration
 * - Seamless inheritance from App\Controller\AppController
 * - Maintains consistency with application-wide security policies
 * - Preserves integration with KMP's service container and dependency injection
 * - Inherits logging, error handling, and middleware configurations
 *
 * ### Plugin-Specific Enhancements
 * - Anonymous submission support without compromising security
 * - GitHub API integration preparation and configuration
 * - Standardized feedback workflow component management
 * - Plugin activation state awareness and conditional functionality
 *
 * ## Component Management
 *
 * ### Flash Component Integration
 * The Flash component is configured for standardized user feedback:
 * - Success messages for completed submissions
 * - Error handling with user-friendly messaging
 * - Validation feedback for form submission issues
 * - Progress indicators for multi-step submission workflows
 *
 * ### Authentication and Authorization
 * - Anonymous access configuration for feedback submission
 * - Bypass authentication requirements for public feedback forms
 * - Maintain authorization checks for administrative functions
 * - Security validation without blocking anonymous users
 *
 * ## Usage Examples
 *
 * ### Controller Extension Pattern
 * ```php
 * // Plugin controllers extend from this AppController
 * namespace GitHubIssueSubmitter\Controller;
 * 
 * class IssuesController extends AppController
 * {
 *     public function submit()
 *     {
 *         // Inherits all security and component configurations
 *         // Access to Flash component for user feedback
 *         // Anonymous access support automatically configured
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Feedback Workflow Integration
 * ```php
 * // Using inherited Flash component for user feedback
 * $this->Flash->success('Your feedback has been submitted successfully!');
 * $this->Flash->error('There was an error processing your submission.');
 * 
 * // Anonymous user workflow support
 * if ($this->Authentication->getIdentity() === null) {
 *     // Anonymous submission workflow
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Component Customization
 * ```php
 * // Custom component loading in initialize()
 * public function initialize(): void
 * {
 *     parent::initialize();
 *     
 *     // Plugin-specific component configuration
 *     $this->loadComponent('GitHubApi', [
 *         'timeout' => 30,
 *         'retries' => 3
 *     ]);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Security Considerations
 *
 * ### Anonymous Submission Safety
 * - Input validation and sanitization inherited from BaseController
 * - CSRF protection maintained for all form submissions
 * - Rate limiting should be implemented at the web server level
 * - Session security for anonymous user workflow tracking
 *
 * ### Integration Security
 * - Secure inheritance of KMP's authentication and authorization framework
 * - Proper isolation of plugin functionality within security boundaries
 * - GitHub API security considerations for token management
 * - Audit trail integration for submission tracking and monitoring
 *
 * ## Integration Points
 *
 * ### KMP Application Architecture
 * - Service container integration for dependency injection
 * - Event system integration for plugin lifecycle management
 * - Middleware stack inheritance for request/response processing
 * - Template engine integration for consistent UI rendering
 *
 * ### GitHub API Services
 * - Preparation for GitHub API integration components
 * - Secure token management for API authentication
 * - Request/response handling for GitHub issue creation
 * - Error handling for API failures and network issues

     * Initialize method - Plugin-specific component and security configuration
     *
     * This method can be overridden to provide plugin-specific initialization
     * while maintaining all the security and component configurations from
     * the base KMP AppController. It serves as the foundation for all
     * GitHubIssueSubmitter plugin controllers.
     *
     * ## Component Loading Strategy
     * 
     * The initialization process provides the foundation for:
     * - Anonymous submission security baseline
     * - GitHub API integration preparation
     * - Standardized user feedback management
     * - Plugin activation state management
     *
     * ## Security Configuration
     * 
     * Inherits and maintains:
     * - Authentication component with anonymous bypass support
     * - Authorization component with plugin-specific policies
     * - Flash component for user feedback workflows
     * - Input validation and sanitization components
     *
     * @return void
     * 
     * @example Plugin-Specific Component Loading
     * ```php
     * public function initialize(): void
     * {
     *     parent::initialize();
     *     
     *     // Load GitHub API integration component
     *     $this->loadComponent('GitHubApi');
     *     
     *     // Configure Flash component for feedback workflows
     *     $this->Flash->setConfig('clear', true);
     * }
     * ```
     */
    // Note: initialize() method can be added when plugin-specific functionality is needed
}
