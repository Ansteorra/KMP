## Learnings

<!-- Append new learnings below. Each entry is something lasting about the project. -->

### 2026-02-10: Test Suite — Summary (summarized from detailed audit)

**88 test files** (35 core + 53 plugin). ~536 test methods. Estimated real coverage: ~15-20%.

**Well-tested:** Authorization service (unit + edge cases + branch scoping), Members CRUD, App settings, Branches, Permissions/Roles, Gatherings, KMP helper, Officers plugin, Waivers plugin.

**Major gaps:** 20/26 core controllers untested, 26/32 tables, 29/34 entities, 36/37 policies, 6/7 commands, 0 mailer tests, 0 API tests. Activities plugin: all stubs. Awards: 0 real tests.

**Test infrastructure:**
- `BaseTestCase` → transaction wrapping + seed data constants (ADMIN_MEMBER_ID=1, TEST_MEMBER_AGATHA_ID=2871, BRYCE=2872, DEVON=2874, EIRIK=2875, KINGDOM_BRANCH_ID=2, TEST_BRANCH_LOCAL_ID=14)
- `HttpIntegrationTestCase` → HTTP tests with `TestAuthenticationHelper`
- `PluginIntegrationTestCase` → plugin HTTP tests (requires `PLUGIN_NAME` constant)
- Database: seeded via `SeedManager` + `dev_seed_clean.sql`, NOT CakePHP fixtures
- Run: `cd app && composer test` or `vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite {core-unit|core-feature|plugins|all}`
- Queue plugin (31 tests) has own fixture system — leave alone

### 2026-02-10: KmpHelper Static State Bug (production code fix)

`KmpHelper::$mainView` is static — persists across PHPUnit test runs. `beforeRender()` stored first View and never updated, causing all subsequent tests to write blocks to a stale View. Fix: compare `$view->getRequest()` instead of just `isset()`. File: `app/src/View/Helper/KmpHelper.php` (4 lines). No production impact (static resets per PHP process).

### 2026-02-10: Template HelloWorldControllerTest Fix

- Must use `PluginIntegrationTestCase` (not `HttpIntegrationTestCase`) — Template plugin commented out in `config/plugins.php`
- Must call `enableCsrfToken()`, `enableSecurityToken()`, `authenticateAsSuperUser()` in setUp
- Flash assertions: use `$_SESSION['Flash']['flash']` not `assertFlashMessage()` (CakePHP trait reads wrong session key in KMP)

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Architecture overview documented — 6 plugins, 37 policy classes, PermissionsLoader is security backbone, 8 dangerous-to-change areas — decided by Mal
📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Backend patterns documented — 14 critical conventions to follow, transaction ownership split (AWM=caller, WM=self), termYears is actually months — decided by Kaylee
📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Frontend patterns documented — 81 Stimulus controllers cataloged, asset pipeline via webpack.mix.js, no frontend test infrastructure exists — decided by Wash
📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Test infrastructure attack plan created — 6 phases, Jayne owns Phases 1-3, 4.1, 4.2a, 5, 6. No new features until testing is solid. — decided by Mal, Josh Handel
📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Auth triage complete — 15 TEST_BUGs, 2 CODE_BUGs classified. Kaylee fixed both CODE_BUGs (PermissionsLoader revoker_id, ControllerResolver string handling). All 370 project-owned tests now pass. — decided by Jayne, Kaylee
📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Auth strategy decided — standardize on TestAuthenticationHelper, deprecate old traits. ⚠️ Gap: authenticateAsSuperUser() does not set permissions — must be fixed before migrating tests. — decided by Mal
