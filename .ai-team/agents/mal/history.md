## Learnings

<!-- Append new learnings below. Each entry is something lasting about the project. -->

### 2026-02-10: Architecture Overview (summarized from full map)

#### Structure
CakePHP 5.x app in `/app/` with Docker orchestration. Three services: PHP/Apache, MariaDB 11, Mailpit. Frontend: Stimulus.JS + Turbo Frames (Drive disabled) + Bootstrap 5.3.6, built via Laravel Mix (`app/webpack.mix.js`).

#### Plugin Ecosystem
**Active domain:** Activities (auth/activities, API), Officers (warrants/rosters, API), Awards (recommendations/state machine), Waivers (gathering waivers). **Infrastructure:** Queue (async jobs), GitHubIssueSubmitter. **Inactive:** Template (reference impl), Events (not implemented). **Third-party:** DebugKit, Bake, Tools, Migrations, Muffin/Footprint, Muffin/Trash, BootstrapUI, Authentication, Authorization, ADmad/Glide, CsvView.

Plugin registration: `config/plugins.php` → Plugin class implements `KMPPluginInterface` → `bootstrap()` registers navigation/cells/settings → optional DI in `services()` → API via `KMPApiPluginInterface`. Enable/disable: `Plugin.{Name}.Active` AppSetting.

#### Services & DI
Core DI: AWM (no txn), WM (owns txn, depends on AWM), CsvExport, ICal, Impersonation. Plugin DI: OfficerManager (AWM+WM), AuthorizationManager. Static: NavigationRegistry, ViewCellRegistry, ApiDataRegistry. All return `ServiceResult(success, reason, data)`.

#### Auth Architecture
Dual auth: session+form (web), Bearer token (API). Policy-based authorization with ORM+Controller resolvers. 37 policies, all extend BasePolicy (super-user bypass in `before()`). Permission chain: Members→MemberRoles→Roles→Permissions→PermissionPolicies→Policies. Three scopes: Global, Branch Only, Branch+Children. Cached via PermissionsLoader.

#### Dangerous to Change
1. BaseEntity/BaseTable hierarchy  2. PermissionsLoader + permission chain  3. ServiceResult pattern  4. NavigationRegistry/ViewCellRegistry static registration  5. Middleware order  6. ActiveWindowBehavior temporal logic  7. Transaction ownership (AWM=caller, WM=self)  8. window.Controllers registration pattern

#### Key Paths
Application: `app/src/Application.php`. KMP core: `app/src/KMP/`. Services: `app/src/Services/`. Controllers: `app/src/Controller/` (26 + Api/). Policies: `app/src/Policy/` (37 files). Config: `app/config/`. Plugins: `app/plugins/`. Frontend: `app/assets/js/`. Tests: `app/tests/TestCase/`. Build: `app/webpack.mix.js`.

### 2026-02-10: Test Infrastructure Attack Plan

Josh directed all features paused until testing is solid. 6-phase plan created:
1. Make suites runnable (delete duplicates, fix constants) ✅ DONE
2. Fix state leakage (migrate to BaseTestCase) ✅ DONE
3. Auth consolidation (standardize TestAuthenticationHelper) — gap found
4. Auth failure investigation (15 TEST_BUG, 2 CODE_BUG) ✅ DONE
5. Remove dead weight (delete stubs, fix warnings)
6. CI pipeline (GitHub Actions)

Key decisions: Standardize TestAuthenticationHelper (deprecate old traits). Queue plugin excluded. ViewCell stubs to be deleted. Constants: KINGDOM_BRANCH_ID=2, TEST_BRANCH_LOCAL_ID=14.

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Backend patterns documented — 14 critical conventions including ServiceResult, transaction ownership, entity/table hierarchy, and authorization flow — decided by Kaylee
📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Frontend patterns documented — 81 Stimulus controllers cataloged, asset pipeline, tab ordering, inter-controller communication via outlet-btn — decided by Wash
📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Test suite audited — 88 files but ~15-20% real coverage, 36/37 policies untested, no CI pipeline, recommend adding CI test runner as Priority 1 — decided by Jayne
📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Josh directive — no new features until testing is solid. Test infrastructure is the priority. — decided by Josh Handel
📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Auth triage complete — 15 TEST_BUGs, 2 CODE_BUGs. Kaylee fixed both CODE_BUGs. All 370 project-owned tests now pass (was 121 failures + 76 errors). — decided by Jayne, Kaylee
📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Auth strategy gap identified — authenticateAsSuperUser() does not set permissions. Must be fixed before Phase 3.2 test migration. — decided by Mal

### 2026-02-10: Queue Plugin Architectural Review

Josh directed us to "own" the Queue plugin — it's a forked copy of `dereuromark/cakephp-queue` (MIT, CakePHP 5.x) that's been in-repo and already significantly modified to fit KMP patterns (BaseEntity/BaseTable, KMPPluginInterface, authorization, NavigationRegistry).

#### Key Findings
- **47 source files, 7,628 lines** — medium-sized plugin, core engine is ~1,500 lines
- **Only integration point:** `QueuedMailerAwareTrait` → `MailerTask` for async email (8 callsites across MembersController, WarrantManager, OfficerManager)
- **Already diverged from upstream** — entities extend BaseEntity, tables extend BaseTable, policy system integrated, navigation registered
- **Cron-driven:** `bin/cake queue run` every 2 minutes via Docker entrypoint
- **Security concern:** `ExecuteTask` allows arbitrary `exec()` from queued data — must be disabled/removed
- **Dead weight:** 8 example tasks, 2 unused mail transports, stale vendor directory

#### Decision
Own it. The divergence is too deep to re-sync, and we use a tiny fraction of its features. Slim it down, remove security risks, and treat as stable infrastructure.

#### P0 Actions
1. Disable/remove `ExecuteTask` (arbitrary command execution)
2. Remove/ignore example tasks from production

📌 Full review: `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/mal-queue-architecture-review.md`

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Queue plugin ownership review — decided to own the plugin, security issues found, test triage complete

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Documentation accuracy review completed — all 4 agents reviewed 96 docs against codebase

### 2026-02-10: Documentation Modernization Pass

Completed 8 documentation tasks fixing cross-references, data models, interface signatures, and migration orders across plugin docs.

#### Key Findings
- **Waivers plugin doc was severely outdated** — only covered ~half the plugin. Full rewrite from source code covering 4 entities, 4 tables, 8 policies, 9 JS controllers, 3 services, 2 view cells, 13 migrations.
- **Awards data model had phantom `active` fields** — Award, Domain, Level, and Event entities all had `active: bool` in the Mermaid diagram that doesn't exist in any entity. Award was also missing 6 real fields (abbreviation, insignia, badge, charter, open_date, close_date).
- **Migration orders were wrong in 5-plugins.md** — Officers/Awards were swapped in the Categories section. Queue, Bootstrap, GitHubIssueSubmitter had fabricated migrationOrder values (10, 12, 11) when they have no migrationOrder in plugins.php. Reports and OfficerEventReporting plugins were listed but don't exist. Example config had nonexistent keys (dependencies, conditional, description, category, required).
- **OfficerManagerInterface.release() had wrong param count** — doc showed 5 params (with `$releaseStatus`), interface actually has 4. The 5th param is implementation-only.
- **RecommendationsTablePolicy used `matching()` not `contain()`** — doc showed `contain(['Awards.Levels'])->where()`, actual code uses `matching('Awards.Levels', ...)`. Also undocumented: global access sentinel value `-10000000` that bypasses branch scoping.
- **Cross-reference rot** — `5.2.2-awards-event-entity.md` and `5.2.3-awards-domains-table.md` never existed.
- **Section number mismatch** — 5.4 filename but 5.5 title for GitHubIssueSubmitter.
