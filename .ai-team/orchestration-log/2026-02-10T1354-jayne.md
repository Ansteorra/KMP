| **Agent** | Jayne (Tester) |
| **Task** | Deep test infrastructure assessment — run tests, assess cleanup, evaluate quality |
| **Mode** | background |
| **Requested by** | Josh Handel |
| **Why this agent** | Josh specifically requested Jayne investigate testing infrastructure |
| **Files read** | app/phpunit.xml, app/tests/bootstrap.php, app/tests/TestCase/BaseTestCase.php, app/tests/TestCase/Support/*, all 88 test files, docker-compose.yml, dev_seed_clean.sql |
| **Files produced** | .ai-team/decisions/inbox/jayne-test-infrastructure-deep-dive.md, .ai-team/agents/jayne/history.md (updated) |
| **Outcome** | Completed (silent success — response lost but files verified). Ran full test suite: 2 of 4 suites crash (namespace collision), 230/280 tests pass in runnable suites, 7 auth test failures, 73% of test files lack transaction wrapping, 2 wrong BaseTestCase constants. Produced detailed 5-phase fix plan. |
