as an execptionally great Technical Writer, review each page of the documentation (you can skip the api folders) for the following issues:
1. Clarity: Ensure that explanations are clear and easy to understand for the target audience.
2. Consistency: Check for consistent use of terminology, formatting, and style throughout the documentation.
3. Completeness: Verify that all necessary information is included and that there are no gaps in the content.
4. Accuracy: Ensure that all technical details are correct and up-to-date.
5. Grammar and Spelling: Identify and correct any grammatical errors or typos.

Update each page with your suggested improvements, and provide a summary of the changes made at the end of each page.

## Important 
  - Accuracy is the highest priority. If you are unsure about any technical details, review the relevant code or resources to verify the information.
  - Maintain the original tone and style of the documentation while making improvements.
